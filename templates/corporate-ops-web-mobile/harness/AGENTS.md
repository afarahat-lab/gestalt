## What this project is

{{projectDescription}}

## Architecture rules

1. Modules never import from each other's internals — only from index.ts
2. All database access through the repository pattern
3. Every state-changing operation produces an audit record (GP-001)
4. RBAC enforced at middleware, never inline (GP-002)

## When context is missing

Emit a `CONTEXT_GAP` signal with the specific missing information identified.

## Operator notes — Git credential scopes

The personal access token registered with this project drives BOTH the
platform's clone/push and the deploy layer's CI/CD calls. Required scopes:

- **GitHub PAT (classic)** — `repo` (clone, push, create PRs) +
  `workflow` (dispatch GitHub Actions workflows). Fine-grained PATs need
  Contents: read+write, Pull requests: read+write, Actions: read+write,
  Workflows: read+write.
- **GitLab Project Access Token** — `api` + `write_repository`.
- **Azure DevOps PAT** — `Code (Read & Write)` + `Build (Read & Execute)`.

Without the workflow scope the deploy layer's pipeline-agent will fail with
a `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` signal and the intent will be escalated for
human review. Re-issue the PAT with the missing scope and re-register the
project to recover.
