_Concise capability snapshot. For HOW each capability was built,
see [sessions/RECENT.md](./sessions/RECENT.md) (last 3 sessions) or
the `sessions/archive/` files (everything older)._

**Last updated:** 2026-06-07 (after TR_022 — scaffolding fixes + phase retry budget + live re-test of the planning loop on a 5-phase feature. Migration 025 adds `feature_phases.retry_count`. `HarnessConfig.planner` gains `maxPhaseRetries` (default 2). `handlePlanningEvaluate` rewritten: on phase failure, re-dispatches `planning:phase` for the same phase until the budget is exhausted; only then marks the feature blocked. trackeros tsconfig.json gets `resolveJsonModule` + `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`; HARNESS.json + template get a `no require() for JSON imports` code-agent rule. Template 0.8.0 → 0.9.0. **Live verified**: feature `1a5dcfc5` (leave management, 5 phases) exercised the retry budget end-to-end (3 attempts on phase 1, all failing on Aider DTO-field hallucination — not a planning bug); feature `37799ea9` (test flag flip) proved the per-phase architecture pass fires when `architectureReviewPerPhase: true`.

## What is built and verified

### Platform foundations

- All 13 buildable packages compile (`pnpm -r build`).
- `docker-compose up -d` brings server + postgres + redis healthy.
- All 25 migrations apply on first start.
- Server reachable on `http://localhost:3000`; `/health` returns 200;
  protected routes return 401 without a JWT.
- Dashboard SPA served at `/app/*`; shareable deep-link URLs work.
- First-boot bootstrap verified: `gestalt init-admin` → `gestalt login`
  → `/auth/me` returns the user.

### Five SDLC layers (all wired end-to-end)

- **generate** — intent → design → context → lint-config → code → test;
  custom agents in `agents.yaml` interleave via `runs_after`.
- **quality-gate** — constraint-agent + review-agent (both LLM,
  ADR-041 — gate runs AFTER CI, not before pr-agent). Gate clones
  the PR branch, checks it out, and reads source files directly
  from the working tree (`readFromBranch: true`). On pass dispatches
  `deploy:promotion` (staging); on fail forwards `resumeOnBranch`
  so the retry leg pushes to the same PR. Verdict:
  `pass` / `fail` (auto-retry) / `escalate` (GP_BREACH).
  Max gate retries: 3. Pre-CI lint/security/test-runner stubs
  deleted — CI uses the project's own ESLint / Vitest / Semgrep
  via the comprehensive `gestalt.yml` workflow template.
- **deploy** — pr-agent → pipeline-agent → promotion-agent
  (staging → production). `PipelineAdapter` interface;
  `GitHubActionsAdapter` + `NoOpPipelineAdapter` implemented.
  ADR-034 production-requires-staging enforced. Auto-merge supported
  via `pipeline.autoMerge` in HARNESS.json.
- **maintenance** — drift / alignment / gc / evaluation, scheduled via
  `node-cron`. Context-file intents take a direct-fix path via
  context-fixer (path-guarded to `docs/*` + `AGENTS.md`).
  `MonitoringAdapter` (Prometheus / Datadog / NoOp).
- **planning** (migration 024) — three agents (architecture-agent /
  planner-agent / phase-evaluator-agent) drive an autonomous feature
  decomposition loop. Operator submits a feature; orchestrator clones
  the repo, runs architecture-agent for the high-level design, runs
  planner-agent for the phase plan, commits `PLAN.md` + appends to
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, then dispatches phase 1 as a regular
  `generate:intent`. The in-process event bus subscriber maps each
  phase intent's terminal status (`deployed` / `failed`) into a
  `planning:evaluate` dispatch; phase-evaluator-agent decides whether
  to continue, adjust remaining phases, or escalate. Bounded by
  `HARNESS.json.planner` (`maxPhasesPerFeature`, `maxFilesPerPhase`,
  `architectureReviewPerPhase`). All LLM guidance prose lives in
  `agents.yaml` (`prompt_extensions`) + `HARNESS.json.agentConfig`
  (`rules` / `architectureGuidance` / `phaseScopingRules` /
  `evaluationCriteria`) per ADR-042 — `.ts` carries only structural
  framing + JSON schemas.

### Identity + auth

- Local auth (non-production only, ADR-025).
- Kerberos / SAML / OIDC providers (ADR-024); `auth.config.json`
  primary source, HARNESS.json `identity` block fallback (ADR-040).
- Two-tier role model: platform roles (`platform-admin` | `user`),
  project roles (`project-admin` | `editor` | `reader`).
- Platform groups for bulk assignment (Brief 1, migration 018);
  effective project role = max of direct + group-derived.
- Server-side membership enforcement on every read + write endpoint;
  no-enumeration-leak rule (empty array, not 403).
- Hot-reload of identity providers without server restart
  (`POST /platform/identity/reload`).

### Platform admin surfaces

- **Users** — CRUD + deactivate + self-protection guards.
- **Projects** — platform-admin create / delete (with active-intents
  guard) / list with cross-project enrichment (members / intents /
  last activity).
- **Groups** — CRUD, members, project assignments with role
  precedence.
- **LLM registry** (migration 014) — per-row baseUrl / apiKeyEnv /
  apiShape (`chat-completions` vs `responses` for gpt-5/o1/o3).
- **Secrets vault** (migrations 015+016) — AES-256-GCM encrypted,
  master key at `/etc/gestalt/master.key` or
  `GESTALT_MASTER_KEY` env; rotation tooling (migration 021).
- **Self-healing** (migration 020) — 7 per-failure-type configs;
  diagnostician picks `retryTaskType` + hints; alerts auto-resolve
  at high confidence.
- **Templates** — harness templates table (migration 017) +
  download / duplicate / edit / push / diff (dashboard + CLI).
  Built-in templates read-only; duplicate first to customise.
- **MCP servers** — platform-wide MCP servers (`platform_mcp_servers`).
- **Self-healing** + **identity** dashboard tabs.

### Project lifecycle

- `gestalt init` registers project; server clones repo, generates
  stack config via LLM (`generateStackConfig`), substitutes
  variables into harness template, commits + pushes.
- Phase-1 project description accepts multi-line input via a
  three-mode chooser (single-line default / END-terminated /
  `$EDITOR`). The full body is passed verbatim into
  `generateStackConfig` and into the template's
  `{{projectDescription}}` substitution. Template engine
  JSON-escapes substituted values when the target file is `.json`
  (engine.ts `substitute(..., { jsonEscape: true })`) so newlines
  + quotes + control chars in the description land safely inside
  HARNESS.json string literals; markdown / yaml files keep raw
  newlines.
- Vault-backed Git PATs (migration 022) — operators link a vault
  secret to a project; resolver decrypts server-side per-cycle.
- GitHub repo browser via `/platform/git/repos` proxy.
- Dynamic harness — LLM picks language / framework / package
  manager / test runner at init time.

### Agent infrastructure

- `BaseLLMAgent` in `@gestalt/core/agents` — every LLM-using agent
  in every layer extends it. Captures `lastPrompt` /
  `lastLlmResponse` / `lastModelUsed` / `lastTokensUsed`
  (accumulated across every LLM call inside one `run()`).
- Built-in file tools (ADR-038, migration 012): `readFile`,
  `listDirectory`, `searchFiles`, `getFileTree`. Read-only,
  path-traversal-guarded.
- MCP integration (ADR-039) — external tool servers per-agent in
  `agents.yaml`. Namespace prefix prevents collision with built-ins.
- Per-agent LLM model override + tools.builtin + tools.mcp +
  prompt_extensions, all driven by `agents.yaml` in the project repo.
- Custom agents (ADR-037) — prompt-only LLM runners declared by the
  project; topo-sorted via `runs_after`.
- Section-based prompts (architecture / constraints / scope /
  design / intent / principles / domain / signals / task) — every
  LLM-generating agent opens with non-negotiable rules.

### Observability + operator surfaces

- Per-agent `agent_executions` + `agent_execution_logs` rows
  (migration 007 + 009 + 012) with prompt / response / model /
  tool calls / **tokens used** (BaseLLMAgent's `lastTokensUsed`
  accumulator wired through the generate + gate orchestrators
  on 2026-06-04; deploy + maintenance are non-LLM today).
- Live event bus (`@gestalt/core/events`) → SSE at
  `/events`. Dashboard subscribes for instant updates.
- IntentDetail accordion with prompt + LLM response + tool calls
  + signals + artifacts.
- Active agents card with cycle progress + token totals.
- Deployments view: 4/5-node pipeline timeline (5th node for
  auto-merged cycles).
- Maintenance view: per-run findings expansion panel.
- Alerts: per-type bodies + interventions (ADR-021).
- Pipeline failure alerts with operator feedback → resume on the
  same branch (migration 019).
- Operator-driven CLI parity: `gestalt run --watch` /
  `gestalt intent / gate / deploy / agents active /
  maintenance / status --graph --watch`.

### CLI

- Bootstrap: `init-admin`, `login`, `init`, `run`, `status`, `logs`.
- Project: `projects list/use/set-adapter/update-token`;
  `project config show/set-agent/set-pipeline/add-custom-agent/...`
- Alerts: `alerts list/show/fix/dismiss/resume/abort/acknowledge/
  pipeline-feedback`.
- Platform admin (gated to platform-admin): `users`,
  `platform llms / secrets / projects / templates / mcp /
  tools / identity / groups / self-healing`.
- Intent: `intent list/show/submit` with `--watch` + filters
  (`--source`, `--priority`, `--search`, `--from`, `--to`).
- Templates push + diff (added 2026-06-04).
- Shared multi-line prompt helpers in `@gestalt/cli/ui/prompts`:
  `promptMultiline` / `promptWithEditor` /
  `promptMultilineDescription`. Used by `gestalt init` (Phase 1
  description) and `gestalt project config add-custom-agent`
  (prompt body). Backwards-compatible single-line default.

---

## Implemented with caveats

- **Quality-gate** — ADR-041 (TR_018): pre-CI lint / security /
  test-runner stubs were deleted. Gate now runs `constraint-agent`
  + `review-agent` AFTER CI passes, reading source files directly
  from the PR branch. CI owns lint / unit-tests / security scan
  via the project's own tooling.
- **Deploy** — `GitHubActionsAdapter` + `NoOpPipelineAdapter` are
  the only implementations. Azure DevOps / GitLab CI / Jenkins
  are typed stubs in the `PipelineAdapterType` union.
- **Maintenance** — `Prometheus` / `Datadog` `MonitoringAdapter`
  implementations exist but aren't yet verified against a real
  monitoring instance. NoOp is the verified path.
- **Identity** — Local + OIDC verified end-to-end via the
  Keycloak fixture. SAML compiles + the route shape is verified
  but full end-to-end against a real IdP only exercised once.
  Kerberos provider compiles; not exercised end-to-end (needs a
  real AD + krb5.keytab).

---

## What is not yet built

- `@gestalt/adapter-oracle` — every repository method throws.
- `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` — every repository method throws.
- `@gestalt/registry` — types + client only; no server, no UI.
- Non-GitHub `PipelineAdapter` impls (Azure DevOps / GitLab CI /
  Jenkins).
- GitLab / Azure DevOps / Bitbucket support in
  `/platform/git/repos` (GitHub only today).
- LDAP group lookup for Kerberos identities (Kerberos tickets
  carry user only; groups need AD query).

---

## Active follow-ups (small)

### PLANNING_LAYER — Autonomous feature decomposition (migration 024)

New `@gestalt/agents-planning` package + `planning:start` / `planning:phase`
/ `planning:evaluate` task types on a new `gestalt-planning` BullMQ
queue. Three new agent roles (architecture-agent / planner-agent /
phase-evaluator-agent), three new postgres tables (features /
feature_phases / feature_plan_log), `POST /features` route, and
`gestalt feature submit/list/show` CLI commands. The orchestrator
loop: clone repo → architecture-agent → planner-agent → write
PLAN.md → commit + push → dispatch phase 1 as `generate:intent` →
event-bus subscriber catches terminal status → planning:evaluate
→ phase-evaluator-agent → either next phase, mark feature
completed, or block. Strict ADR-042 compliance — every guidance
prose string lives in `agents.yaml.prompt_extensions` or
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig[role]` (`rules` / `architectureGuidance`
/ `phaseScopingRules` / `evaluationCriteria`); only structural
framing + JSON schemas live in `packages/agents/planning/src/prompts/`.
Live verified on trackeros: feature `ea19b18e` ran the full loop
end-to-end against real GitHub Actions CI (CI failed due to a
pre-existing code-agent issue; the planning loop correctly marked
the phase failed and the feature blocked). Template bumped
0.7.0 → 0.8.0.

### TR_021 — Externalise verificationGuidance to HARNESS.json

Refactor (kept brief; see `sessions/RECENT.md` for the full
narrative). Lifted project-specific "HOW to verify before
flagging" hints out of `llm-review-agent.ts` and into
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig[role].verificationGuidance`. PLANNING_LAYER
extended the same helper to render three more sub-section types
(phaseScopingRules, evaluationCriteria, architectureGuidance).
Template went 0.6.0 → 0.7.0 → 0.8.0.

### TR_020 — Real GitHub Actions deploy works end-to-end

trackeros's first `Status: ✓ deployed` against the real
`github-actions` adapter — 1m 58s, single round, PR #54
squash-merged. See `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_020.md`.

### Resolved by TR_020 (kept brief)

Gate retry budget threading + ABSOLUTE_MAX_RETRIES + CI dedupe
all resolved. See `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_020.md` for the full
diff.

### Active follow-ups (carryover or NEW)

- **(HIGH — NEW from TR_022)** Aider DTO-field hallucination —
  Aider's generated repository / service code references fields
  not present on the DTO (e.g. `Property 'employeeId' does not
  exist on type 'CreateLeaveRequestDto'`). Three consecutive
  attempts on the leave-management feature's phase 1 all
  produced the same class of error; the retry budget bailed
  cleanly, but the feature didn't progress. Either extend the
  code-agent prompt with a "READ the DTO file first" rule or
  require model + repository in the same Aider call. Tracked
  as TR_023.
- **(LOW — NEW from TR_022)** `readMaxPhaseRetries` re-clones
  HARNESS.json on every failure dispatch. Cheap (~250ms) but
  could be cached per-feature for the lifecycle.
- **~~(MEDIUM — PLANNING_LAYER)~~ RESOLVED by TR_022.**
  Phase failure → feature blocked was too eager. Now bounded
  by `planner.maxPhaseRetries` (default 2) and verified live
  on feature `1a5dcfc5`.
- **~~(MEDIUM — PLANNING_LAYER)~~ RESOLVED by TR_022.**
  Original Aider `resolveJsonModule` failure mode addressed
  in trackeros tsconfig + template default code-agent rule.
- **~~(LOW — PLANNING_LAYER)~~ RESOLVED by TR_022.** Per-phase
  architecture review verified live on feature `37799ea9`.
- **(LOW — NEW from PLANNING_LAYER)** The orchestrator stores
  phase scope adjustments under `feature_phases.result.pendingScopeAdjustment`
  and the next `planning:phase` reads them when assembling the
  intent text. The scope itself never overwrites the original
  `scope` column — by design, so the planner's first draft stays
  visible to operators. Consider a dedicated `scope_history` array
  if operators need a full history.
- **(LOW — NEW from TR_021)** Consider migrating the
  `consistencySection` block (cross-artifact checks:
  test-framework match, import resolution, @types/* coverage,
  test-file placement) out of `llm-review-agent.ts`'s
  `buildReviewPrompt` into HARNESS.json verificationGuidance.
  Borderline platform-mechanic / project-specific; works fine
  in code today but a non-Node project might want to tune it.
- **(LOW — NEW from TR_021, structurally addressed)** The TR_020
  "extend trust-CI to constraint-agent" item is now a one-line
  edit to `agentConfig['constraint-agent'].verificationGuidance`
  in HARNESS.json. Not added in TR_021 because constraint-agent
  doesn't currently hit the hallucination; documented here so
  the next regression can be fixed without a code change.
- **(MEDIUM — TR_019, still relevant)** `gestalt init` should
  scaffold a `.gitignore` + align jest/ts-jest/@types/jest
  versions with TypeScript. trackeros's jest@27 + TS@5 mismatch
  was latent under `noop`; same scaffolding should align Node 22.
- **(LOW — TR_019, still relevant)** Template
  `{{ciSetupSteps}}` for Node/npm should add `--legacy-peer-deps`
  on `npm install` until the upstream npm arborist
  `Link.matches` bug is fixed.
- **(LOW — TR_019, still relevant)** Add a `tsc --noEmit` sanity
  check on scaffolded tests in `gestalt init`.

### Carryovers (TR_018 / TR_014)

- **(HIGH — TR_018)** Restore the TR_010 mandatory `executeScript
  tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on trackeros's HARNESS.json. CI's
  `Compile` step catches the same errors post-hoc but the rule
  catches them pre-emit during Aider's generation.
- **(MEDIUM — TR_014)** Aider token-spend visibility. Parse
  `Tokens: N sent / M received` from Aider's stdout. code-agent
  rows still show 0 tokens across all rounds.

### Architecture follow-ups (all LOW unless marked)

Pruned to top items; see `sessions/archive/` for the full
historical list.

- Retry cycle full re-runs all generate agents — skip
  intent/design/context when artifacts in Git tip.
- `qualityGate.maxRetries` + `planner.maxPhasesPerFeature`
  hardcoded fallbacks (3 / 10) — wire through HARNESS reads
  for projects that override.
- Promotion workflow dispatches against hardcoded `'main'` ref.
  Projects on `master` / `trunk` will fail.
- No proactive PAT-scope validation at registration.
- Encrypt Git PATs at rest in legacy `project_git_credentials`.
- LLM model name not validated at startup.
- (MEDIUM, TR_004) test-agent punts on method coverage.

---

## Operator caveats / pending actions

### trackeros state (current)

- **trackeros `main`** at commit `b99e1716` (post-TR_022
  HARNESS.json restored — `architectureReviewPerPhase: false`,
  `maxPhaseRetries: 2`). Pipeline adapter `github-actions` +
  autoMerge true. tsconfig.json carries `resolveJsonModule` +
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.
- **PR cleanup**: TR_019 + PLANNING_LAYER stranded PRs (#49–#52,
  #57) closed with `--delete-branch` during TR_022. New PRs from
  TR_022's verification cycles (#58–#62) currently open under
  the blocked leave-management feature — leave until TR_023
  lands the Aider DTO fix.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. Both LLMs currently in env-var
  mode (`apiKeyEnv: 'LLM_API_KEY'`) and working.
- **Open alerts to dismiss**: cycle alerts from TR_010–TR_019.
  Dismissable with `gestalt alerts dismiss <id>`.
- **`.env`**: `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o` (operator default).
- **`master.key`** generated locally (workspace root, mode 600,
  gitignored) + mounted into the container via
  `docker-compose.yml`. Survives `docker compose up -d --build`.
  Back up out-of-band; losing it makes every vault-encrypted
  secret unreadable.

---

## CLI install

`@gestalt/cli` is private — not on npm.
```bash
pnpm --filter @gestalt/cli build && cd packages/cli && npm link
```

---

## First-boot sequence

1. `docker-compose up -d` — start platform.
2. `gestalt init-admin` — create admin user (TTY only, once
   per server).
3. `gestalt login` — authenticate CLI.
4. `mkdir my-project && cd my-project && git init && git remote
   add origin <url>`.
5. `gestalt init` — register project + server pushes harness.
6. `git pull` — receive harness files locally.
7. `gestalt run "<intent>"` — submit work to agents.

---


## How to run builds

```bash
pnpm -r build                 # build all packages (topological order)
pnpm --filter @gestalt/core typecheck

docker-compose up -d          # postgres + redis + server (production stage)
docker-compose logs -f server
```

---

## Current build status

| | |
|---|---|
| `pnpm -r build` | ✅ clean (13 packages) |
| `docker-compose up -d` | ✅ healthy (server / postgres / redis) |
| Migrations applied | 025 (latest: `025_feature_phase_retry`) |
| Server reachable | `http://localhost:3000/health` returns 200 |
| Dashboard | served at `http://localhost:3000/app/` |

The 13 buildable packages: `@gestalt/core`, `@gestalt/adapter-postgres`,
`@gestalt/adapter-oracle` (stub), `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` (stub),
`@gestalt/agents-generate`, `@gestalt/agents-quality-gate`,
`@gestalt/agents-deploy`, `@gestalt/agents-maintenance`,
`@gestalt/agents-planning` (migration 024), `@gestalt/registry`,
`@gestalt/server`, `@gestalt/cli`, `@gestalt/dashboard`.

---

## Known issues

None blocking the build. Areas to keep in mind:

1. **`UserRepository` / `ProjectRepository` extensions touch every
   adapter.** Adding a method means Oracle + MSSQL stubs must add the
   same method (as throw-stubs is fine). Build will fail until every
   adapter implements the new surface.
2. **CLI pins chalk@4 / ora@5 for CJS compatibility.** Do not upgrade
   either without performing the full ESM migration (`"type":
   "module"`, `.js` extensions on relative imports, Dockerfile
   update). The pin is intentional.
3. **Dashboard bundle 1010 KB raw / 319 KB gzipped** after the
   CodeMirror addition. Above Vite's 500 KB warning. Acceptable for an
   admin-only feature.
4. **LLM model name not validated at startup.** `loadConfig` accepts
   any non-empty string for `LLM_MODEL`. Invalid model surfaces as a
   404 on the first LLM call.

---

## Pending operator actions

### TR_022 — Scaffolding fixes + phase retry budget (migration 025)

Three operator-facing changes plus a verified end-to-end retest
of the planning loop on a 5-phase feature.

- **Migration 025** — `feature_phases.retry_count INTEGER NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 0`. Existing rows start at 0.
- **`HarnessConfig.planner.maxPhaseRetries`** — new optional field,
  default 2 (one initial attempt + 2 retries). Set to 0 to
  restore pre-TR_022 single-attempt behaviour.
- **Template HARNESS.json** — `agentConfig.code-agent.rules` gets
  the JSON-import rule; `planner.maxPhaseRetries: 2` added.
  Template bumped 0.8.0 → 0.9.0.
- **`stack-config.ts`** — TypeScript stacks always carry the
  JSON-import rule in `agentPromptExtensions` (LLM path + the
  default-config path).

trackeros migrated as part of the verify cycle:
- `tsconfig.json` gains `resolveJsonModule` +
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.
- `HARNESS.json` gets `code-agent.rules` JSON-import rule +
  planner block bumped to `{10, 5, false, 2}`.

**Operator action:** Existing projects can adopt the new
`maxPhaseRetries` field by editing `HARNESS.json.planner`.
Absent → defaults to 2 in `readMaxPhaseRetries`.

### PLANNING_LAYER — Autonomous feature decomposition (migration 024)

New package `@gestalt/agents-planning` + new BullMQ queue
`gestalt-planning` + new postgres tables (features /
feature_phases / feature_plan_log) + new server routes
(`POST/GET /features`, `GET /features/:id`) + new CLI commands
(`gestalt feature submit/list/show`). Three new agent roles
(architecture-agent / planner-agent / phase-evaluator-agent),
all extending BaseLLMAgent and reading config from agents.yaml +
HARNESS.json `agentConfig`. New `HARNESS.json.planner` block
(`enabled`, `maxPhasesPerFeature`, `maxFilesPerPhase`,
`architectureReviewPerPhase`) opt-in per project. Template
bumped 0.7.0 → 0.8.0. Live verified on trackeros — feature
`ea19b18e` ran the full architecture → plan → phase 1 → CI →
event-bus → evaluate loop end-to-end against real GitHub
Actions; phase failed because Aider's generated TS used
`require('package.json')` without `resolveJsonModule` (pre-
existing code-agent issue unrelated to planning).

**Operator action:** Add the planner block + planning
agentConfig entries to existing projects' `HARNESS.json` to
opt in. trackeros has been migrated as part of the verify
cycle (commit `3fc936fe` on `main`).

### ADRs 042–049 — Platform/operator split and related principles codified

Documentation-only session. Eight ADRs appended to
`docs/DECISIONS.md`: ADR-042 (LLM guidance prose lives in
HARNESS.json + agents.yaml, never `.ts`), ADR-043 (Aider opt-in
backend), ADR-044 (gpt-4o for gate, gpt-4o-mini for code-gen),
ADR-045 (evidence requirement — every finding needs a
`quotedLine`), ADR-046 (LLM-driven script execution for gate
verification — no hardcoded script commands), ADR-047 (CI/CD
owns runtime verification; gate owns architectural review —
extends ADR-041), ADR-048 (LLM-driven retry routing via
`SelfHealingDiagnosis.retryTaskType`, no hardcoded dispatch
maps), ADR-049 (architecture agent uses phased consultation —
`designFeature()` + `designPhase()` — not single-call full
design). No platform code change; no migrations.

**Operator action:** None. ADRs are read-only contracts the
platform already honours.

### TR_021 — Externalise gate-agent verificationGuidance to HARNESS.json

Refactor: STEP 1-5 verification protocol lifted from
`llm-review-agent.ts` into
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig[role].verificationGuidance`. Platform
mechanics (evidence requirement, severity ceiling, JSON schema,
parser-level dropUnevidencedFindings, ABSOLUTE_MAX_RETRIES) stay
in code. constraint-agent gained the configurable section "for
free" via the shared `renderHarnessAgentRules` helper. Template
bumped 0.6.0 → 0.7.0. Two trackeros cycles deployed
single-round (PR #55 pre-commit no-regression + PR #56
post-commit prompt-render verified). No new migrations.

### TR_020 — First clean github-actions deploy

trackeros's first `Status: ✓ deployed` against the real
`github-actions` adapter: 1m 58s, single round, PR #54
squash-merged. Four fixes: console.log rule scope, retryCount
threading, CI trigger dedupe (3→1), executeScript stripped +
"trust CI" prompt. Template bumped 0.5.0 → 0.6.0.

**Resolved (structurally) by TR_021:**
- ~~LOW — TR_020: extend "trust CI" rule to constraint-agent~~ —
  now a one-line edit to
  `agentConfig['constraint-agent'].verificationGuidance` in
  HARNESS.json; no platform code change required.

### Carryovers (TR_019 / TR_018 / TR_014)

- **MEDIUM — TR_019:** `gestalt init` should scaffold a
  `.gitignore` + align jest/ts-jest/@types/jest versions with
  TypeScript. trackeros's jest@27 + TS@5 mismatch was latent
  under `noop` and only surfaced when CI ran jest.
- **LOW — TR_019:** Template `{{ciSetupSteps}}` for Node/npm
  should include `--legacy-peer-deps` on `npm install` until the
  upstream npm arborist `Link.matches` bug is fixed.
- **LOW — TR_019:** Add a `tsc --noEmit` sanity check on
  scaffolded tests in `gestalt init`.
- **HIGH — TR_018:** Restore TR_010 mandatory `executeScript
  tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on trackeros's HARNESS.json.
- **MEDIUM — TR_014:** Aider token-spend capture. Parse
  `Tokens: N sent / M received` from Aider's stdout and surface
  as `tokens_used` on the execution row.

### Recent trackeros operator commits (already pushed)

- `13223d29` (TR_021) — HARNESS.json `verificationGuidance`
  arrays added to constraint-agent + review-agent blocks.
- `f926e840` (TR_020) — agents.yaml review-agent tools stripped
  + trust-CI prompt extension.
- `99a48c73` (TR_020) — HARNESS.json console.log rewording +
  gestalt.yml pull_request trigger removed.

### Platform state caveats (unchanged)

- **`master.key`** generated locally (workspace root, mode 600,
  gitignored) + mounted into the server container via
  `docker-compose.yml`. Survives `docker compose up -d --build`.
  Back up out-of-band; losing it makes every vault-encrypted
  secret unreadable.
- **Open alerts to dismiss**: prior cycle alerts from
  TR_010–TR_018 (`gestalt alerts list` shows the full set).
  All dismissable with `gestalt alerts dismiss <id>`.
- **Live-verify TEST_REPORT_003 Fix 1** (env-default LLM
  apiShape) by switching `LLM_MODEL=chat-latest` + setting
  `platform_llms.chat-latest.api_shape='responses'` and
  confirming `max_completion_tokens` reaches the wire.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. Both LLMs currently in env-var
  mode (`apiKeyEnv: 'LLM_API_KEY'`) and working.

### Session 2026-06-07 — Claude Code (TR_022: scaffolding fixes + phase retry budget + per-phase architecture verification — full planning loop live-tested on leave management feature)

Follow-up to PLANNING_LAYER. Three fixes plus four verification
runs against trackeros to confirm the planning loop is fully
operational under real CI.

What changed (code):

- **Migration 025** — `ALTER TABLE feature_phases ADD COLUMN
  retry_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`. Existing rows
  start at 0 so the semantics on the next cycle match
  pre-TR_022 behaviour exactly.
- **`@gestalt/core`** — `HarnessConfig.planner` gains optional
  `maxPhaseRetries` (default 2 — one initial attempt + 2
  retries = 3 total per phase). `FeaturePhaseRecord` gains
  `retryCount: number`. `FeatureRepository` gains
  `incrementPhaseRetry(phaseId): Promise<number>`. Postgres
  impl plus Oracle/MSSQL throw-stubs all updated.
- **`@gestalt/agents-planning`** — `handlePlanningEvaluate`'s
  failure branch rewritten. Instead of immediately marking the
  feature blocked, the orchestrator reads
  `planner.maxPhaseRetries` via a fast shallow-clone helper
  (`readMaxPhaseRetries` — appended at the bottom of
  `planning-orchestrator.ts`), compares to `phase.retryCount`,
  and either dispatches a fresh `planning:phase` for the same
  phase (logged as `phase-retry`) or transitions to
  `phase-failed` with budget exhausted. The retry uses the
  same phase row — same scope, same architecture notes — so
  the next-round Aider sees identical inputs.
- **`packages/server/src/templates/stack-config.ts`** —
  `buildStackPrompt` extended with a TypeScript-specific
  paragraph instructing the LLM to include the JSON-import rule
  in `agentPromptExtensions`. `parseStackConfig` defensively
  injects the rule (via the new `TS_JSON_IMPORT_RULE` const)
  whenever `language === 'TypeScript'` and the LLM forgot it.
  `DEFAULT_AGENT_PROMPT_EXTENSIONS` updated so the failure-
  default path also carries the rule.
- **Template (`templates/corporate-ops-web-mobile/harness/HARNESS.json`)** —
  `planner.maxPhaseRetries: 2` added; `agentConfig.code-agent.rules`
  gains the JSON-import rule. Template bumped 0.8.0 → 0.9.0.

trackeros operator commits (already on `main`):

- `a7494aaa` — tsconfig.json `resolveJsonModule` +
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`; HARNESS.json
  `code-agent.rules` JSON-import rule; planner block bumped
  to `{maxPhasesPerFeature: 10, maxFilesPerPhase: 5,
  architectureReviewPerPhase: false, maxPhaseRetries: 2}`.
- `b99e1716` — revert of the temporary
  `architectureReviewPerPhase: true` test toggle.

Live verification matrix:

| Check (from brief) | Verified? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| architecture-agent runs | ✓ | Feature `1a5dcfc5`: log entry `architecture-designed Feature architecture: 4 module(s), 2 recommended phase(s)` at 19:12:53 |
| PLAN.md committed to repo | ✓ | trackeros commit `ebd5bbdf` |
| docs/ARCHITECTURE.md updated | ✓ | "Leave Management Module" section appended in same commit |
| Phase 1 intent submitted automatically | ✓ | Plan log `phase-submitted [phase 1] … intent 8f93f513` at 19:13:10 |
| **TR_022 — retry budget honoured** | ✓ | Plan log shows `phase-retry 1/2` at 19:16:22 and `phase-retry 2/2` at 19:19:41 before `phase-failed after 2 retries` at 19:22:44 |
| **TR_022 — per-phase architecture review fires when opted in** | ✓ | Feature `37799ea9` (test-only flag flip): log entry `phase-architecture-designed [phase 1] Phase 1 architecture: 1 interface(s), 3 criteria` at 19:24:59 between `plan-built` and `phase-submitted` |
| CI passes after tsconfig fix | ✗ partial | The TS5083 `resolveJsonModule` class is fixed (no longer flagged). New failures are property-mismatch errors in Aider's generated code (e.g. `Property 'employeeId' does not exist on type 'CreateLeaveRequestDto'`) — a pre-existing code-agent / Aider problem, not a tsconfig issue |
| Phase 1 deploys | ✗ | Blocked by the Aider issue above |
| Phase evaluator runs | ✗ | Only runs on successful deploy — guarded by design |
| Phase 2 submitted | ✗ | Same reason |
| `gestalt feature show <id>` renders progress correctly | ✓ | Three live polls in this session, including the retry events |

The brief's primary verification target — the **autonomous
planning loop with retry budget** — passed every check. The
secondary target (clean deploy through CI) is gated on the
Aider behaviour follow-up, captured below.

PLAN.md produced for the leave-management feature
(5 phases, 4 modules, 3 domain entities):

```markdown
# PLAN.md — Leave management module

## Modules
- **leave** (`src/modules/leave`)
- **balance** (`src/modules/balance`)
- **policy** (`src/modules/policy`)
- **employee** (`src/modules/employee`)

## Domain entities
- **LeaveRequest** — id, employeeId, type, startDate,
  endDate, status, managerId, managerComment, createdAt
- **LeaveBalance** — employeeId, leaveType, totalDays,
  usedDays, year
- **LeavePolicy** — id, leaveType, defaultDaysPerYear,
  maxConsecutiveDays, requiresApproval, createdAt

## Phases
1. Create leave model
2. Implement leave request submission (depends on Phase 1)
3. Implement leave request approval (depends on Phase 2)
4. Create leave balance management (depends on Phase 1)
5. Implement leave policy configuration
```

https://github.com/afarahat-lab/trackeros/blob/main/PLAN.md
(commit `ebd5bbdf`).

Decisions made:

- **`readMaxPhaseRetries` does its own shallow clone** rather
  than hoisting harness-read above the failure check. Cleaner
  separation — the retry branch never touches the (larger)
  evaluate-clone path. Cost: ~250ms per failure dispatch on a
  small repo; acceptable for an error path.
- **Retry preserves the original `scope` column** and
  re-dispatches the same `planning:phase` payload. The phase
  row's `scope` / `architecture` are the plan — the retry
  should not mutate the plan, just give Aider another swing
  at it. Operators who want a "smart retry" with a refined
  scope can use the existing `pendingScopeAdjustment`
  mechanism the evaluator already populates.
- **Per-phase architecture verified via a test-flip + revert**
  rather than left permanently enabled on trackeros. The flag
  multiplies architecture-agent cost N-fold per feature; the
  default `false` is the right operator choice on trackeros's
  budget. The verification proved the code path runs; the
  flag is now safe to flip true on any project that wants it.
- **`maxPhaseRetries: 0`** was used during the per-phase
  architecture verification cycle so the test feature didn't
  burn the retry budget on unrelated Aider failures while
  proving the architecture flag's behaviour. Reverted with
  the architecture flag in the same revert commit.

Pending follow-ups (NEW from TR_022):

- **(HIGH)** Aider generates code that references fields not
  present on the DTO (e.g. `employeeId`, `reason`, reason on
  `CreateLeaveRequestDto`). Three consecutive attempts on
  Phase 1 all produced the same class of error. Either
  (a) extend the code-agent prompt with a "before writing a
  service / repository, READ the DTO file and only reference
  the fields you see there" rule, or (b) require Aider to
  emit the model + repository in the same call so the model
  is in its context when writing the repository. Captured as
  TR_023 work.
- **(LOW)** `readMaxPhaseRetries` could cache HARNESS.json
  per feature for the duration of a feature lifecycle —
  today it re-clones on every failure dispatch.

Carryover follow-ups (status updates):

- **(RESOLVED by TR_022)** PLANNING_LAYER's MEDIUM follow-up:
  "phase failure → feature blocked is too eager" — now
  bounded by `planner.maxPhaseRetries`.
- **(RESOLVED by TR_022)** PLANNING_LAYER's LOW follow-up:
  per-phase architecture pass not yet live-verified —
  verified via feature `37799ea9`.
- **(STILL OPEN — NEW HIGH)** TR_023 — Aider DTO-field
  hallucination (described above).
- **(STILL OPEN — HIGH)** TR_018/020: restore TR_010
  mandatory `executeScript tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on
  trackeros's HARNESS.json. Would catch this class of error
  pre-emit.
- **(STILL OPEN — MEDIUM)** TR_014: Aider token-spend
  capture in `agent_executions.tokens_used`.

Build status: `pnpm -r build` clean across all 13 packages.
Migration 025 applied at boot. Template auto-refreshed:
`version: "0.9.0"`. Server `/health` 200 throughout.
Stale trackeros PRs #49–52, #57 closed with
`--delete-branch` per the brief. New trackeros PRs from this
session (#58–#62) all closed automatically by the gate-
failure path or remain open under the blocked feature — not
worth closing individually until the Aider fix lands.

### Session 2026-06-07 — Claude Code (PLANNING_LAYER: autonomous feature decomposition + phased execution — new `@gestalt/agents-planning` package + migration 024 + first live end-to-end loop on trackeros)

Largest single-session build of the platform to date: a complete
new SDLC layer with three new agents, three new postgres tables,
new BullMQ queue, new server routes, and new CLI commands —
implemented strictly to ADR-042 (no LLM guidance prose in `.ts`).

What's new (capability):

- **Three planning agents** all extending `BaseLLMAgent` and
  reading config via the standard `loadAgentConfig` path:
  - **architecture-agent** — two entry points. `designFeature()`
    produces the high-level domain entities / modules / dependency
    map / recommended phase sequence. `designPhase()` produces
    the focused per-phase architecture (interface signatures,
    import paths, success criteria). Phased consultation matches
    ADR-049.
  - **planner-agent** — decomposes a feature into an ordered phase
    plan, bounded by `HARNESS.json.planner.maxPhasesPerFeature` +
    `maxFilesPerPhase`. Each phase is an Aider-ready brief.
  - **phase-evaluator-agent** — runs AFTER each phase deploys
    (or fails), produces a verdict (`success` / `partial` /
    `escalate`) and adjustments to remaining phases.
- **Planning orchestrator** (`@gestalt/agents-planning/dist/orchestrator/planning-orchestrator.js`)
  drains the new `gestalt-planning` BullMQ queue and handles
  three task types: `planning:start` (architecture → plan →
  PLAN.md commit → dispatch phase 0), `planning:phase` (clone →
  optional per-phase architecture pass → create generate:intent),
  and `planning:evaluate` (clone → phase-evaluator-agent → next
  phase OR mark feature completed/blocked).
- **Event-bus subscriber** in the planning worker bridges deploy
  back to planning without any coupling code in the deploy layer:
  it watches `intent.status-changed` events, looks up the phase
  row by intent id, and dispatches `planning:evaluate` on
  terminal status (`deployed` / `failed` / `escalated`).
- **`POST /features`, `GET /features`, `GET /features/:id`** routes
  with the same project-membership guards as `/intents`.
- **`gestalt feature submit/list/show`** CLI commands with a
  short-title default + plan-log rendering.

What's new (data + types):

- **Migration 024** (`024_features.sql`) — `features` (top-level
  feature row with `status`, `phase_count`, `current_phase`,
  `architecture`), `feature_phases` (one row per phase with
  `intent_id` reverse-lookup + `result` JSONB), `feature_plan_log`
  (append-only operator-visible event log). Three indexes,
  three CHECK constraints, FK CASCADE on `features.project_id`.
- **Type extensions** in `@gestalt/core`:
  - `AgentRole` gains `architecture-agent`, `planner-agent`,
    `phase-evaluator-agent`.
  - `TaskType` gains `planning:start`, `planning:phase`,
    `planning:evaluate`.
  - `HarnessAgentConfig` gains optional `phaseScopingRules?`,
    `evaluationCriteria?`, `architectureGuidance?` — same
    convention as `verificationGuidance` from TR_021.
  - `HarnessConfig` gains optional `planner` block (`enabled`,
    `maxPhasesPerFeature`, `maxFilesPerPhase`,
    `architectureReviewPerPhase`).
- **Repository surface** — new `FeatureRepository` interface in
  `@gestalt/core/repository` with 15 methods (CRUD across the
  three tables + reverse-lookup + log append). Postgres impl in
  `packages/adapters/postgres/src/repositories/features.ts`;
  Oracle + MSSQL throw-stubs added for interface-drift safety.
- **Queue** — `QUEUE_NAMES.planning = 'gestalt-planning'` +
  `resolveQueueName` updated.

What's new (template):

- **`templates/corporate-ops-web-mobile/harness/HARNESS.json`** —
  new `planner` block + new `agentConfig['architecture-agent']`,
  `agentConfig['planner-agent']`, `agentConfig['phase-evaluator-agent']`
  blocks carrying `rules` + the new field types
  (`architectureGuidance`, `phaseScopingRules`,
  `evaluationCriteria`).
- **`templates/corporate-ops-web-mobile/harness/agents.yaml`** —
  added three planning-agent entries with `prompt_extensions`
  carrying the project-specific design / planning / evaluation
  prose. Operators tune per project without touching `.ts`.
- **Template version 0.7.0 → 0.8.0** (`template.json`).

What was extended (existing code):

- **`renderHarnessAgentRules`** in `packages/core/src/agents/base-llm-agent.ts`
  rewritten to render five optional sub-sections in fixed order
  (Rules, Verification guidance, Phase scoping rules,
  Evaluation criteria, Architecture guidance). Existing
  callers (`constraint-agent`, `review-agent`, `code-prompt`)
  gain the new sections "for free" — no per-agent code change.
- **`buildHarnessAgentSection`** class method signature widened
  to match.
- **`packages/server/src/server.ts`** — calls `startPlanningWorker(config.queue)`
  after the maintenance scheduler. **`packages/server/src/app.ts`** —
  registers `/features` routes.
- **`packages/server/Dockerfile`** — adds the planning package
  to the workspace manifest copy + builder + production stages.

ADR-042 compliance (what stays in `.ts` vs what goes in
`HARNESS.json` + `agents.yaml`):

| Stays in `.ts` (platform mechanic) | Goes in `HARNESS.json` / `agents.yaml` (operator-tunable) |
|---|---|
| Role / goal framing skeleton | Role + goal text |
| JSON response schemas | All guidance prose |
| `renderHarnessAgentRules` helper | Rules + verification guidance |
| Loop logic + queue dispatch | Phase scoping examples |
| Git operations + PLAN.md writer | Evaluation criteria |
| Repository persistence | Architecture guidance |
| Parser-level evidence enforcement | (everything an operator might want to change) |

Architecture choice — the orchestrator hooks deploy → planning
via the in-process event bus rather than a queue dispatch from
the deploy layer. The deploy layer is fully unchanged: it
already emits `intent.status-changed` to the bus on every
status transition; the planning worker subscribes and decides
whether the event matches a phase intent. Zero coupling code
landed in `@gestalt/agents-deploy`.

Live verification — first end-to-end loop on trackeros:

- **Feature** `ea19b18e-e55d-4bf7-b0be-ce5f8d20b6aa` ("Add
  /version endpoint with test") submitted via
  `gestalt feature submit ... --project trackeros`.
- **`planning:start`** dispatched within milliseconds. Planning
  worker cloned trackeros, ran architecture-agent (~4s, 1 module
  + 1 recommended phase), ran planner-agent (~3s, 1 phase).
- **`PLAN.md` committed and pushed** to trackeros `main`
  (commit `6f2a500b`). Content:
  ```
  # PLAN.md — Add /version endpoint with test
  ## Modules
  - **version** (`src/modules/version/`) — owns: version.routes.ts, version.test.ts
  ## Phases
  ### Phase 1: Implement /version endpoint
  Create src/modules/version/version.controller.ts that exports
  getVersion() returning the version from package.json. Create
  version.routes.ts to define the /version endpoint. Include a
  Jest unit test in tests/unit/version.test.ts.
  ```
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` appended** with the architecture-agent's
  `architectureMdUpdate` ("Version Endpoint" section).
- **Phase 1 intent** `e00e993c-...` created with status `pending`
  → `generating`. Generate ran (intent → design → context →
  code), pr-agent opened **PR #57**, pipeline-agent triggered
  CI run `27101236260`.
- **CI failed** because Aider's generated `version.controller.ts`
  used `require('../../../package.json')` without `resolveJsonModule`
  in tsconfig. Self-healing dispatched a retry (regenerate +
  push to the same branch); CI failed identically. Intent
  transitioned to `failed`.
- **Event-bus subscriber fired** — `intent.status-changed` with
  `status=failed` matched phase `7847f...`; `planning:evaluate`
  dispatched.
- **Phase marked `failed`, feature marked `blocked`**, plan log
  appended with `phase-failed` event. End-to-end loop confirmed.

The CI failure is pre-existing code-agent / Aider behaviour
(TR_022 / TR_023 will address it) — not a planning bug. The
planning loop did exactly what it was supposed to do.

Decisions made:

- **Event bus, not deploy-layer dispatch**, for the deploy →
  planning callback. Keeps the deploy layer completely unaware
  of the planning layer.
- **Failed phase = blocked feature, no retry**. The phase-evaluator-
  agent is consulted only when the intent deploys successfully;
  on failure the orchestrator marks the phase failed without
  asking the LLM. Future iteration could add a per-feature
  retry budget that the evaluator decides — captured as a
  follow-up.
- **Per-phase architecture pass disabled for trackeros**
  (`architectureReviewPerPhase: false`). The feature-level
  architecture suffices for trackeros's 1-phase scope; the
  second architecture-agent entry point is exercised when
  operators opt in.
- **Scope adjustments stored under `feature_phases.result.pendingScopeAdjustment`**
  rather than overwriting `feature_phases.scope`. Keeps the
  original plan visible to operators; the next `planning:phase`
  reads the adjustment when assembling the intent text.

Pending follow-ups (NEW from PLANNING_LAYER):

- **(MEDIUM)** Phase failure → feature blocked is too eager.
  Add a per-feature retry budget so a single CI failure doesn't
  block the whole plan. Could be HARNESS-tunable
  (`planner.maxPhaseRetries`).
- **(LOW)** Per-phase architecture pass not yet live-verified.
  Flip `architectureReviewPerPhase: true` on a fresh trackeros
  feature to confirm the second `architecture-agent` entry
  point assembles the prompt correctly.
- **(LOW)** `feature_plan_log` is append-only. A `gestalt feature
  log <id>` CLI subcommand would let operators tail it without
  the JSON shell of `gestalt feature show`.

Carryover follow-ups (status updates):

- **(NEW — code-agent issue surfaced by planning)** Aider's
  generated TypeScript uses `require('package.json')` without
  the project's tsconfig allowing it. Either (a) scaffold
  `resolveJsonModule: true` + `esModuleInterop: true` in
  `gestalt init`, or (b) extend code-agent's prompt with an
  "Aider tips for TypeScript" section.
- **(STILL OPEN — HIGH)** TR_018/020: restore TR_010 mandatory
  `executeScript tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on trackeros's
  HARNESS.json. Would catch this CI failure pre-emit.
- **(STILL OPEN — MEDIUM)** TR_014: Aider token-spend capture
  in `agent_executions.tokens_used`.

Build status: `pnpm -r build` clean across all 13 packages
(adds `@gestalt/agents-planning`). Docker image rebuilt with
the new package wired into the multi-stage build. Migration
024 applied at boot. `gestalt-planning` BullMQ queue worker
started. Server `/health` 200 throughout. Template
auto-refreshed at boot: `version: "0.8.0"`. trackeros `main`
updated with two commits: `3fc936fe` (HARNESS.json planner +
planning agentConfig) and `6f2a500b` (PLAN.md +
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md from feature `ea19b18e`).

### Session 2026-06-07 — Claude Code (ADRs 042–049: codify platform/operator split + Aider backend + gate model policy + evidence requirement + LLM-driven script verification + CI-owns-runtime + LLM-driven retry routing + phased architecture)

Documentation-only session. Eight ADRs added to `docs/DECISIONS.md`
codifying principles either learned through TR_007 → TR_021 or that
govern the upcoming planning-feature implementation. No platform
code change; no migrations.

What was added:

- **ADR-042** — LLM prompt content belongs in HARNESS.json +
  agents.yaml, not in TypeScript files. Codifies TR_021's refactor
  as a permanent rule. Stays in `.ts`: schemas, framing, evidence
  enforcement, parsing, severity caps. Goes in `agents.yaml`: role
  / goal / prompt_extensions / domain guidance. Goes in
  `HARNESS.json agentConfig`: rules + verificationGuidance +
  project-specific hints. Code reviews must reject `.ts` PRs that
  add LLM guidance prose.
- **ADR-043** — Aider as opt-in code generation backend. Enabled
  per-project via `HARNESS.json codeGeneration.backend: "aider"`.
  The Aider message stays minimal — task, rules, architecture
  context only. HOW to implement is Aider's call. Custom
  code-agent retained as default for non-opt-in projects.
- **ADR-044** — Gate agents require gpt-4o; code generation uses
  gpt-4o-mini. Codifies TR_015 + TR_016 finding: gpt-4o-mini
  cannot follow rules that contradict its training bias (8 rounds
  flagging `pool.query()` in `*.repository.ts` despite explicit
  "this is CORRECT" rule). gpt-4o for the gate (small call
  volume); gpt-4o-mini for Aider's tool loop (200k TPM ceiling).
- **ADR-045** — Evidence requirement for all finding-emitting
  agents. Every finding must include `quotedLine` with the exact
  code quoted verbatim. Findings without `quotedLine` are dropped
  by `dropUnevidencedFindings()` before reaching the gate verdict.
  Eliminates hallucinated findings structurally, not via prompt
  engineering.
- **ADR-046** — LLM-driven script execution for gate verification.
  No hardcoded script commands in platform `.ts` files. LLM
  decides what to run based on project language / stack /
  finding. `HARNESS.json agentConfig.verificationGuidance` gives
  hints; the LLM picks the approach. Platform-level blocklist on
  destructive operations (rm -rf, git push, git commit, sudo,
  curl | bash) is never configurable.
- **ADR-047** — CI/CD owns runtime verification; Gestalt gate
  owns architectural review. Extends ADR-041. lint-agent /
  security-agent / test-runner-agent removed permanently. CI runs
  the project's own ESLint / Jest / Semgrep — more accurate than
  platform stubs. Re-adding those agents to the gate is
  explicitly prohibited.
- **ADR-048** — Self-healing uses LLM-driven retry routing, not
  hardcoded dispatch maps. `SelfHealingDiagnosis.retryTaskType`
  is the authoritative dispatch decision. The LLM understands
  failure semantics (git non-fast-forward → deploy-layer, TS
  compile error → generate-layer) without per-case programming.
  Unknown failures fall through to `generate:intent`.
- **ADR-049** — Architecture agent uses phased consultation, not
  single-call full design. Two modes: `designFeature()` (high-level
  — domain entities, module list, phase sequence, no impl detail)
  and `designPhase()` (focused — interface signatures, import
  paths, SQL schema, measurable success criteria; receives prior
  phases' actual code as context). High-level design committed to
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` before any code generation. Future CrewAI
  migration becomes an architecture crew (chief / data / app
  architect) on the same two-mode pattern.

Commits:

- `013e49f` — ADR-042 (committed and pushed earlier in session)
- `<TBD>` — ADRs 043–049 + RECENT.md / STATE.md / BUILD.md /
  SUMMARY.md regeneration (this commit)

Decisions made:

- **Ordered ADRs 042–049 by the principle they govern**, not
  chronologically by when the lesson was learned. ADR-042 (the
  split itself) leads because it defines the framework the others
  live within.
- **Did not change platform code.** The ADRs codify behaviour
  that's already deployed (or that governs the planning feature
  about to be built); they're a contract, not a refactor. Future
  PRs that violate any ADR must justify the deviation in their
  own ADR amendment.
- **No new follow-ups added.** Every ADR points at code that
  already exists or at the planning feature about to be built.

Build status: no platform code change. `pnpm -r build` not
re-run. Docker image untouched. No new migrations. TR_019 session
rotated to `sessions/archive/2026-06-w1.md` to keep RECENT.md
under the 3-session / 40 KB ceiling.
