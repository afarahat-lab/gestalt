# BUILD.md — Build status + known issues

## How to run builds

```bash
pnpm -r build                 # build all packages (topological order)
pnpm --filter @gestalt/core typecheck

docker-compose up -d          # postgres + redis + server (production stage)
docker-compose logs -f server
```

---

## Current build status

| | |
|---|---|
| `pnpm -r build` | ✅ clean (13 packages) |
| `docker-compose up -d` | ✅ healthy (server / postgres / redis) |
| Migrations applied | 027 (latest: `027_self_healing_pr_agent`) |
| Server reachable | `http://localhost:3000/health` returns 200 |
| Dashboard | served at `http://localhost:3000/app/` |

The 13 buildable packages: `@gestalt/core`, `@gestalt/adapter-postgres`,
`@gestalt/adapter-oracle` (stub), `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` (stub),
`@gestalt/agents-generate`, `@gestalt/agents-quality-gate`,
`@gestalt/agents-deploy`, `@gestalt/agents-maintenance`,
`@gestalt/agents-planning` (migration 024), `@gestalt/registry`,
`@gestalt/server`, `@gestalt/cli`, `@gestalt/dashboard`.

---

## Known issues

None blocking the build. Areas to keep in mind:

1. **`UserRepository` / `ProjectRepository` extensions touch every
   adapter.** Adding a method means Oracle + MSSQL stubs must add the
   same method (as throw-stubs is fine). Build will fail until every
   adapter implements the new surface.
2. **CLI pins chalk@4 / ora@5 for CJS compatibility.** Do not upgrade
   either without performing the full ESM migration (`"type":
   "module"`, `.js` extensions on relative imports, Dockerfile
   update). The pin is intentional.
3. **Dashboard bundle 1010 KB raw / 319 KB gzipped** after the
   CodeMirror addition. Above Vite's 500 KB warning. Acceptable for an
   admin-only feature.
4. **LLM model name not validated at startup.** `loadConfig` accepts
   any non-empty string for `LLM_MODEL`. Invalid model surfaces as a
   404 on the first LLM call.

## Pending operator actions

### TR_034 — Scoped per-phase architecture replaces full architecture context in Aider message (template 0.19.0, mechanisms verified)

Replaces the heavyweight `## Project architecture` + `## Design
context` blocks in the Aider message with a single
`## Scoped architecture for this phase` block built from
architecture-agent's `designPhase()` JSON (interfaces +
importStatements + sqlSchema + successCriteria). Closes the
TR_033 root cause where Aider hallucinated `../../shared/db`
from module-name references in the full ARCHITECTURE.md.

- `buildAiderMessage` signature: `(intentSpec, phaseArchitecture:
  string | null, snapshot)`. New `renderPhaseArchitecture()` helper.
- New `FeatureRepository.updatePhaseArchitecture` method (no
  migration — uses existing column). Postgres impl + oracle/mssql
  stubs.
- `runPerPhaseArchitecture` persists JSON to `phase.architecture`.
- `aider-code-agent.loadPhaseArchitectureForCycle` resolves
  correlationId → intent → phase → architecture, parses with
  shape guard.
- Template HARNESS + agents.yaml gain new architecture-agent
  scoping rules (architectureGuidance + prompt_extensions) with
  WRONG/CORRECT examples banning module-name-only references.

Template bumped 0.18.0 → 0.19.0. **Verified live on trackeros
2026-06-10** — per-phase architecture pass fires,
`updatePhaseArchitecture` persists JSON, message body shrank
5705 → 2922 bytes, Phase 1 deployed via PR #119. **Feature did
NOT complete** — gpt-5.5 + Aider produced zero source code
(same TR_033 mode), and architecture-agent's `designPhase`
returned empty arrays so the scoped block was empty too.

**Operator action — trackeros:** none new beyond the brief's
HARNESS + agents.yaml edits (committed by the verification
cycle as `e7db89dd` + `4eb7637c` cleanup).

**Operator action — other projects:** Existing projects can
opt into the per-phase architecture pass by setting
`HARNESS.json.planner.architectureReviewPerPhase: true` and
ensuring `architectureGuidance` includes the path/exports/
import-statement rules from the template. Template auto-
refreshes at server boot to `0.19.0`. The Aider message
behaviour change is fully backward-compatible — projects
without per-phase architecture get `null` from
`loadPhaseArchitectureForCycle` and the message drops the
section entirely.

### TR_033 — Phase 3 quality gaps + escalation→blocked structural fix (template 0.18.0, partially verified)

Four targeted fixes pushing toward full autonomous feature
completion. **Verified live on trackeros feature `7ab81ea3`
(2026-06-10)**: Fix 1 + Fix 4 confirmed end-to-end; Fix 2 +
Fix 3 shipped but not reached (feature blocked at Phase 1
before routes phase). Feature did not reach `completed` —
gpt-5.5 + Aider produced zero source code across 4 attempts
(new failure mode separate from TR_028-32 hallucination).
Full report in `sessions/RECENT.md`. Fixes 1-3 are language-agnostic rule additions;
Fix 4 is the structural follow-up to the TR_032 verification
gap (escalated intents leaving features stuck `in-progress`).

- **Fix 1** — `aider-message-builder.ts` base `readFiles` list
  expanded to include `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`,
  `mypy.ini`, `.eslintrc(.json)`. The adapter's `existsSync`
  filter naturally drops files a project doesn't use, so the
  same list works on TypeScript / Python / Go / Java without
  language-tagging the platform code.
- **Fix 2** — three language-agnostic rules added to
  `agentConfig.code-agent.rules` in the **template** HARNESS:
  read dependency source before calling its methods; read
  compiler/linter config before generating; read dependency
  manifest before importing. Examples in the rule text list
  multiple ecosystems (`tsconfig.json / mypy.ini / pyproject.toml`,
  `package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod`).
- **Fix 3** — new rule on
  `agentConfig.phase-evaluator-agent.rules` (template) — when
  adjusting a routes/controller phase scope, cite the
  service/handler file it depends on. Closes the TR_032 Phase 3
  root cause.
- **Fix 4** — structural. `AlertType` gains `'feature-blocked'`
  (no migration — no DB CHECK constraint on `alerts.type`).
  Planning orchestrator's `intent.status-changed` subscriber
  now treats `waiting-for-clarification` + `escalated` as
  terminal phase outcomes via a new
  `markFeatureBlockedAfterEscalation` helper: phase → failed,
  feature → blocked, `phase-escalated` log entry, a single
  `feature-blocked` alert. Self-healing already parked the
  parent intent at `waiting-for-clarification` when the
  cascade brake fired (`self-healing-loop.ts:604`) — Fix 4
  completes the story.

Template bumped 0.17.0 → 0.18.0. Build clean across all 13
packages. Live verification pending.

**Operator action — trackeros:** my Fix 2 + Fix 3 edits on
trackeros's `HARNESS.json` were reverted by the operator/linter
this session. The new code-agent + phase-evaluator rules only
ship via the template; existing projects (including trackeros)
need a manual patch on their own `HARNESS.json` to opt in. For
the live verification recipe to test Fix 2 + Fix 3 end-to-end,
trackeros's HARNESS must be patched first with the three
code-agent rules and the one phase-evaluator rule from the
template.

**Operator action — other projects:** None on the platform.
Template auto-refreshes at server boot to `0.18.0`. New
projects pick up the rules automatically.

### TR_032 — Aider `--read` flag + preservation in schema + broken-state framing (template 0.17.0, verified)

Three targeted platform-mechanic fixes addressing the
TR_028 → TR_031 Aider DTO-drift blocker. No new HARNESS
rules, no new migrations.

- **Fix 1** — `runAider` accepts `readFiles?: string[]`;
  `buildAiderMessage` returns `{ message, readFiles }`
  (PLAN.md + paths regex-extracted from the intent's scope
  text). The adapter renders each as a `--read "<path>"`
  flag, existsSync-filtered against `workDir`. Removed the
  TR_030/TR_031 prose `## Read PLAN.md first` and
  `## Before generating any code` sections — `--read`
  enforces what they only asked.
- **Fix 2** — preservation sentence ("Preserve all existing
  exports, types, interfaces, and imports. Only add or
  modify what is needed to resolve the CI failure shown
  above.") hard-coded as the closing sentence of the
  `fixIntent` JSON-schema description in
  `self-healing-agent.ts`. HARNESS preservation rule
  removed from the template.
- **Fix 3** — `fixIntent` description now requires BROKEN
  STATE framing (not MISSING STATE) with verbatim
  WRONG/CORRECT examples. Addresses the TR_031 cycle-3
  finding that Aider inverts negation.

Template bumped 0.16.0 → 0.17.0. Build clean across all 13
packages. **Verified end-to-end on trackeros 2026-06-09** —
feature `fd844f7d` Phase 1 + Phase 2 both deployed cleanly
(Phase 2 was the killer phase across TR_028-31, first ship);
Phase 3 escalated on unrelated TS-strict + missing-method
issues (the TR_033 fixes target those). `readFiles` array
present on every Aider invocation. Preservation footer
present on both fix-intents. Cascade brake at depth 2 fired
correctly. Operator had to manually clean up the escalated
feature after the cycle — Fix 4 above closes that gap.

**Operator action:** None new. The TR_032 preservation rule
removal already shipped via the template.

Three targeted platform-mechanic fixes addressing the
TR_028 → TR_031 Aider DTO-drift blocker. No new HARNESS
rules, no new migrations.

- **Fix 1** — `runAider` accepts `readFiles?: string[]`;
  `buildAiderMessage` returns `{ message, readFiles }`
  (PLAN.md + paths regex-extracted from the intent's scope
  text). The adapter renders each as a `--read "<path>"`
  flag, existsSync-filtered against `workDir`. Removed the
  TR_030/TR_031 prose `## Read PLAN.md first` and
  `## Before generating any code` sections — `--read`
  enforces what they only asked.
- **Fix 2** — preservation sentence ("Preserve all existing
  exports, types, interfaces, and imports. Only add or
  modify what is needed to resolve the CI failure shown
  above.") hard-coded as the closing sentence of the
  `fixIntent` JSON-schema description in
  `self-healing-agent.ts`. HARNESS preservation rule
  removed from the template.
- **Fix 3** — `fixIntent` description now requires BROKEN
  STATE framing (not MISSING STATE) with verbatim
  WRONG/CORRECT examples. Addresses the TR_031 cycle-3
  finding that Aider inverts negation.

Template bumped 0.16.0 → 0.17.0. Build clean across all 13
packages. Live verification pending — operator runs the
brief's `gestalt feature submit` recipe on trackeros.

**Operator action:** Existing projects can prune the now-
redundant preservation rule from
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig.self-healing-agent.rules` (it's
in the platform schema now). The rule is harmless if left
in — both fire. trackeros not auto-migrated; operator can
clean up on next HARNESS edit.

### TR_030 + TR_031 — Aider-message-builder + PLAN.md "What has been built" + context-only fix-intent (template 0.16.0)

Two consecutive briefs targeting Aider DTO drift. TR_030
added two generic prose blocks to `aider-message-builder.ts`
(read-existing-files; architecture-is-reference-only).
TR_031 added a `Read PLAN.md first` block to the message-
builder; extended `PhaseEvaluation` with `builtFiles` (the
phase-evaluator-agent now also lists exports per built file
in its git-diff pass); rewrote the `fixIntent` JSON-schema
description in `self-healing-agent.ts` to require CONTEXT
only (no prescriptive "Update X to add Y"). HARNESS
preservation-rule bullet added for self-healing-agent.
Template 0.15.0 → 0.16.0.

Verified end-to-end on a clean trackeros main: PLAN.md
populates the `**What has been built:**` section under each
deployed phase with files + key exports; fix-intent text
is now context-only; self-healing routes to fix-intent
immediately on first failure; cascade brake fires at depth 2.

**Operator action:** Existing projects can adopt the new
preservation rule by appending to
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig.self-healing-agent.rules`:
"Fix-intent context must end with a preservation statement.
For TypeScript projects: 'Do not remove or rename existing
exports, types, or interfaces. Only add or modify what is
needed to resolve the CI failure.'" Python or other
language projects substitute their own preservation clause.
trackeros migrated in commit `7d94746a`.

### TR_029 — Planner+evaluator prior-phase path rules (template 0.15.0)

Two new `agentConfig.planner-agent.phaseScopingRules` items and
one `agentConfig.phase-evaluator-agent.rules` item added,
requiring per-phase explicit prior-file-path lists and full-path
replacement when adjusting scopes after a partial verdict.
Template bumped 0.14.0 → 0.15.0. Pure HARNESS edit — no platform
code change, no migration.

Planner-side verified end-to-end on the re-submitted
leave-management feature: PLAN.md `Phase 2` carries the exact
`src/modules/leave/leave.model.ts` + `leave.repository.ts`
paths the planner was instructed to include. Phase 1 deployed
in ~3 minutes (PR #88). Phase 2 still blocked by Aider
code-agent reading discipline — captured as two NEW HIGH
follow-ups in STATE.md (code-agent prompt mandate + architecture-
agent context scoping).

**Operator action:** Existing projects can adopt the new rules
by merging them into `HARNESS.json.agentConfig.planner-agent.phaseScopingRules`
and `agentConfig.phase-evaluator-agent.rules`. trackeros migrated
as part of this session (commit `cf35c03b`).

### TR_028 — Full planning-loop re-test (TEST_REPORT_028.md)

Milestone test on the leave-management feature, verifying every
TR_020 through TR_027 mechanism in a single 19-minute autonomous
cycle. Phase 1 (model) deployed cleanly. Phase 2 (repository)
hit the known TR_023 Aider DTO-drift; self-healing's
diagnostician correctly chose `retry` then `fix-intent`;
fix-intent child deployed via the `onSuccessDispatch` envelope
in ~2m 25s. But the fix-intent prompt lacked path specificity
so Aider wrote a stray repo-root `/leave.model.ts` that tsc
never resolves. Parent Phase 2 resumed → failed again → planner
retry budget exhausted → feature blocked at 1/4 phases. Two new
HIGH follow-ups captured: (1) promoted TR_023 — planner must
keep model+repository in same phase OR code-agent must read
existing model first; (2) self-healing fix-intent prompt
enrichment — must include the failing import path and existing
field shape. Architecture-agent / planner-agent /
phase-evaluator-agent / PR-Agent / self-healing + onSuccessDispatch /
cascade-depth brake / phase retry budget all verified.

**Operator action:** None on the platform. trackeros next
planner cycle should be prefaced by `git rm leave.model.ts`
(the stray repo-root file fix-intent created). Full
per-phase log at `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_028.md`.

### TR_027 — PR-Agent replaces review-agent (ADR-051)

CodiumAI PR-Agent invoked server-side via `executeScript` after CI
passes. No webhook, no CI step, no GitHub Secrets for LLM keys —
LLM credentials forwarded per invocation via subprocess env vars.
Dockerfile installs PR-Agent in its own venv (`/opt/pr-agent`)
isolated from Aider's because of incompatible litellm versions;
PATH shims (`/usr/local/bin/{aider,pr-agent}`) keep call sites
unchanged. New `prAgent` block on HarnessConfig + `.pr_agent.toml`
generated from HARNESS rules at init time (regeneratable via
`gestalt project config push-pr-agent-config`). Gate orchestrator
skips review-agent when prAgent.enabled + adapter=github-actions;
constraint-agent still runs. `changes-requested` routes through
self-healing's `fix-intent` path via new failure type
`review-requested-changes` (migration 027). Template 0.12.0 →
0.14.0. Live verified end-to-end on trackeros PR #81: Aider 6s →
CI pass → PR-Agent 23.5s → verdict `none` → gate (constraint-agent
only) → deploy. Wall-clock 2m 04s.

**Operator action:** Existing projects can adopt PR-Agent by
adding `prAgent: { enabled: true, blockOnChangesRequested: true,
pendingTimeoutSeconds: 30 }` to HARNESS.json + a self-healing-agent
rule for `review-requested-changes`. Absent → review-agent fallback
path still runs (llm-review-agent.ts kept as `@deprecated` but
functional). trackeros migrated as part of the verify cycle
(commits pending push).

### ADRs 053–055 — Tool integration roadmap

Documentation-only session. Three ADRs appended to
`docs/DECISIONS.md` capturing strategic tool integrations
agreed in the design chat: ADR-053 (Qodo Gen replaces
test-agent in the generate layer), ADR-054 (SWE-agent handles
bug-fix MaintenanceIntents), ADR-055 (K8sGPT feeds a future
Kubernetes operations layer via webhook → MaintenanceIntent).
A new `### Tool integration roadmap` section under
`STATE.md` "Active follow-ups" documents priority order plus
ruled-out alternatives (Bloop.ai — archived; OpenHands —
competitor; GitHub Spec Kit — not self-hostable). All three
ADRs are **Accepted — pending implementation**; no code
change, no migration.

Cross-reference note: ADR-052 (external scanner webhook →
MaintenanceIntent pattern) is referenced by ADR-055 but has
not yet been authored. Backfill when the next session touches
that code. ADR-051 (PR-Agent) was authored alongside this
session.

**Operator action:** None. ADRs are forward-looking contracts;
implementation will land in a later session.

### TR_026 — Remove platform file-change detection (ADR-050 enforcement)

ADR-050 enforcement: the platform must NOT detect, parse, or
interpret which files changed. Two surgical removals plus an
agent-side replacement.

- **AiderAdapter**: `parseAiderChangedFiles` deleted,
  `filesChanged` removed from `AiderResult`. `--yes-always`
  replaces `--yes` to prevent mid-session confirmation hangs.
- **AiderCodeAgent**: new `discoverAiderWrites` helper runs
  `git status --porcelain` in the work-dir and emits each
  changed file as a code artifact. An AGENT calling git —
  not platform code parsing Aider stdout.
- **Phase-evaluator-agent**: 3-stage TR_025 fallback deleted.
  Agent signature changed to take `branchContext`; prompt
  rewritten to instruct it to run `git diff` via
  executeScript. Switched to `callLLMWithTools` so the
  tool-use loop fires.
- **PER_ROLE_DEFAULTS** in `agent-config-loader.ts` extended
  with the three planning agents so executeScript is
  available out of the box.
- **HARNESS.json + agents.yaml** updated on template +
  trackeros: phase-evaluator-agent rules + evaluationCriteria
  rewritten with verbatim git-diff guidance.
- **Template bumped 0.11.0 → 0.12.0**.

Verified live: feature `7d77f659` Phase 1 PR commit
`ce3f3721` contains the real code files (`leave.model.ts` +
test). Phase-evaluator's verdict text quotes the
HARNESS.json git-diff rule, confirming the agent followed
the new path. Full feature completion blocked by
pre-existing trackeros operator state (stale
`leave.repository.ts` from earlier auto-merged cycles) —
captured as TR_027.

**Operator action:** None. Pure platform changes (plus the
trackeros HARNESS.json edit committed by the verification
cycle as `897bcf06`).

### TR_025 — Cascade-depth brake + phase-evaluator file-list fix

Two surgical hardening fixes (no migration):

- **`MAX_FIX_INTENT_DEPTH = 2`** + `getFixIntentChainDepth` walker
  in `packages/core/src/agents/self-healing-loop.ts`. Force-
  escalates when `parent_intent_id` chain depth ≥ 2. Closes
  TR_024's cascading-runaway gap.
- **Planning orchestrator built-file list** sourced from
  `git diff` against the PR branch (filtered to non-
  `.gestalt/` paths). Three-stage fallback: PR-branch diff →
  merged-commit scan → legacy artifacts-table read.

Verified live: feature `eed75889` Phase 1 → success → Phase 2
auto-dispatched. End-to-end autonomous transition confirmed.
Phase 2 hit an unrelated Aider "0 files written" quirk
(TR_026 follow-up).

**Operator action:** None. Pure platform fixes.

### TR_024 — Autonomous systemic gap detection (migration 026)

Self-healing diagnostician can now choose between **retry /
fix-intent / escalate**. When it picks `fix-intent` it writes an
Aider-ready intent the platform submits as a separate generate
cycle, links via `parent_intent_id`, and persists an
`on_success_dispatch` envelope that resumes the parent after
the fix's production promotion. Per ADR-050: no hardcoded
failure-pattern matching anywhere.

- **Migration 026** — `intents.parent_intent_id` (UUID FK
  `ON DELETE SET NULL`) + `intents.on_success_dispatch`
  (JSONB). NULL on every existing intent.
- **`HarnessAgentConfig.self-healing-agent`** added to both
  the template and trackeros: six rules covering the action
  vocabulary + fix-intent quality bar.
- **agents.yaml self-healing-agent block** in template (uses
  platform default model). trackeros overrides `model:
  chat-latest`. The LLM registry handles the
  `apiShape: 'responses'` wire-shape — agent code untouched.
- **`collectCiTechnicalDetail`** (deploy-orchestrator) —
  fetches the failed CI run's GitHub Actions annotations and
  passes them to the diagnostician as `technicalDetail`.
  github-actions only today.
- **Dashboard panels**: 🔧 Auto-fix intent (on `source: 'self-
  healing-fix'` intents); ⏳ Awaiting auto-fix (on parents with
  in-flight fix children).
- **Template bumped 0.10.0 → 0.11.0**.

**Operator action:** Existing projects can adopt the
self-healing-agent rules + agents.yaml block by editing their
own HARNESS.json + agents.yaml. Absent → diagnostician uses
the platform default LLM (no agents.yaml override needed
when the platform default is already chat-latest or similar).
trackeros migrated as part of the verify cycle (commit
`1a4fe16e` on `main`).

### TR_022 — Scaffolding fixes + phase retry budget (migration 025)

Three operator-facing changes plus a verified end-to-end retest
of the planning loop on a 5-phase feature.

- **Migration 025** — `feature_phases.retry_count INTEGER NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 0`. Existing rows start at 0.
- **`HarnessConfig.planner.maxPhaseRetries`** — new optional field,
  default 2 (one initial attempt + 2 retries). Set to 0 to
  restore pre-TR_022 single-attempt behaviour.
- **Template HARNESS.json** — `agentConfig.code-agent.rules` gets
  the JSON-import rule; `planner.maxPhaseRetries: 2` added.
  Template bumped 0.8.0 → 0.9.0.
- **`stack-config.ts`** — TypeScript stacks always carry the
  JSON-import rule in `agentPromptExtensions` (LLM path + the
  default-config path).

trackeros migrated as part of the verify cycle:
- `tsconfig.json` gains `resolveJsonModule` +
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.
- `HARNESS.json` gets `code-agent.rules` JSON-import rule +
  planner block bumped to `{10, 5, false, 2}`.

**Operator action:** Existing projects can adopt the new
`maxPhaseRetries` field by editing `HARNESS.json.planner`.
Absent → defaults to 2 in `readMaxPhaseRetries`.

### PLANNING_LAYER — Autonomous feature decomposition (migration 024)

New package `@gestalt/agents-planning` + new BullMQ queue
`gestalt-planning` + new postgres tables (features /
feature_phases / feature_plan_log) + new server routes
(`POST/GET /features`, `GET /features/:id`) + new CLI commands
(`gestalt feature submit/list/show`). Three new agent roles
(architecture-agent / planner-agent / phase-evaluator-agent),
all extending BaseLLMAgent and reading config from agents.yaml +
HARNESS.json `agentConfig`. New `HARNESS.json.planner` block
(`enabled`, `maxPhasesPerFeature`, `maxFilesPerPhase`,
`architectureReviewPerPhase`) opt-in per project. Template
bumped 0.7.0 → 0.8.0. Live verified on trackeros — feature
`ea19b18e` ran the full architecture → plan → phase 1 → CI →
event-bus → evaluate loop end-to-end against real GitHub
Actions; phase failed because Aider's generated TS used
`require('package.json')` without `resolveJsonModule` (pre-
existing code-agent issue unrelated to planning).

**Operator action:** Add the planner block + planning
agentConfig entries to existing projects' `HARNESS.json` to
opt in. trackeros has been migrated as part of the verify
cycle (commit `3fc936fe` on `main`).

### Historical (TR_020 / TR_021 / ADRs 042–049)

Rotated to `sessions/archive/`. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` for ADRs
and the archive for the full narratives.

### Carryovers (TR_019 / TR_018 / TR_014)

- **MEDIUM — TR_019:** `gestalt init` should scaffold a
  `.gitignore` + align jest/ts-jest/@types/jest with TypeScript.
- **LOW — TR_019:** Template `{{ciSetupSteps}}` for Node/npm
  should include `--legacy-peer-deps` until the upstream npm
  arborist `Link.matches` bug is fixed.
- **LOW — TR_019:** Add a `tsc --noEmit` sanity check on
  scaffolded tests in `gestalt init`.
- **HIGH — TR_018:** Restore TR_010 mandatory `executeScript
  tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on trackeros's HARNESS.json.
- **MEDIUM — TR_014:** Aider token-spend capture. Parse
  `Tokens: N sent / M received` from Aider's stdout and surface
  as `tokens_used` on the execution row.

### Platform state caveats (unchanged)

- **`master.key`** generated locally (workspace root, mode 600,
  gitignored) + mounted into the server container via
  `docker-compose.yml`. Survives `docker compose up -d --build`.
  Back up out-of-band; losing it makes every vault-encrypted
  secret unreadable.
- **Open alerts to dismiss**: prior cycle alerts from
  TR_010–TR_018 (`gestalt alerts list` shows the full set).
  All dismissable with `gestalt alerts dismiss <id>`.
- **Live-verify TEST_REPORT_003 Fix 1** (env-default LLM
  apiShape) by switching `LLM_MODEL=chat-latest` + setting
  `platform_llms.chat-latest.api_shape='responses'` and
  confirming `max_completion_tokens` reaches the wire.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. Both LLMs currently in env-var
  mode (`apiKeyEnv: 'LLM_API_KEY'`) and working.

## Type alignment rules

Moved to [@docs/claude/ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#key-type-alignment-rules).
