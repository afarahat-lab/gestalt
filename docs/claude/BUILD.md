# BUILD.md — Build status + known issues

## How to run builds

```bash
pnpm -r build                 # build all packages (topological order)
pnpm --filter @gestalt/core typecheck

docker-compose up -d          # postgres + redis + server (production stage)
docker-compose logs -f server
```

## Current build status

| | |
|---|---|
| `pnpm -r build` | ✅ clean (12 packages) |
| `docker-compose up -d` | ✅ healthy (server / postgres / redis) |
| Migrations applied | 023 (latest: `023_llm_api_shape`) |
| Server reachable | `http://localhost:3000/health` returns 200 |
| Dashboard | served at `http://localhost:3000/app/` |

The 12 buildable packages: `@gestalt/core`, `@gestalt/adapter-postgres`,
`@gestalt/adapter-oracle` (stub), `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` (stub),
`@gestalt/agents-generate`, `@gestalt/agents-quality-gate`,
`@gestalt/agents-deploy`, `@gestalt/agents-maintenance`,
`@gestalt/registry`, `@gestalt/server`, `@gestalt/cli`,
`@gestalt/dashboard`.

## Known issues

None blocking the build. Areas to keep in mind:

1. **`UserRepository` and `ProjectRepository` extensions touch every
   adapter.** Adding a method to the interface means the Oracle and
   SQL Server stubs must add the same method (as throw-stubs is
   fine). Build will fail until every adapter implements the new
   surface — that's the intent.
2. **CLI pins chalk@4 / ora@5 for CJS compatibility.** Do not upgrade
   either without performing the full ESM migration (`"type":
   "module"`, `.js` extensions on relative imports, Dockerfile
   update). The pin is intentional.
3. **Dashboard bundle is 1010 KB raw (319 KB gzipped)** after the
   CodeMirror addition in the 2026-06-04 template editor session.
   Above Vite's 500 KB warning. Acceptable for an admin-only feature;
   candidate for a future code-split via dynamic `import()`.
4. **LLM model name not validated at startup.** `loadConfig` accepts
   any non-empty string for `LLM_MODEL`. An invalid model only
   surfaces as a 404 on the first LLM call. Set a valid model in
   `.env` (or seed the platform LLM registry) before running
   `gestalt run`.

## Pending operator actions

- **`master.key`** is generated locally (workspace root, mode
  600, gitignored) and mounted into the server container by
  default via `docker-compose.yml`. Survives `docker compose
  up -d --build`. Operator should back this file up out-of-band;
  losing it means every vault-encrypted secret becomes
  unreadable.
- **Two trackeros branches from live test cycles** —
  `gestalt/1e316bbf-…` (Report 002) and `gestalt/57759963-…`
  (Report 003, PR #4706). Close or delete when done.
- **Review-agent placement-check wording fix** is a small
  follow-up (TEST_REPORT_003 Issue #1) — one paragraph in
  `llm-review-agent.ts` to stop false-positive
  `concerns`-grade flags on correctly-mirrored test paths.
- **Live-verify TEST_REPORT_003 Fix 1** (env-default LLM
  apiShape) by switching `LLM_MODEL=chat-latest` + setting
  `platform_llms.chat-latest.api_shape='responses'` and
  confirming `max_completion_tokens` reaches the wire.
- **trackeros `.github/workflows/gestalt.yml`** still pins Node 20
  (project was bootstrapped before the 2026-06-04 Node 22 LTS
  template change). Edit `node-version: '20'` → `'22'` + commit.
  Non-breaking — Node 20 still works.
- **trackeros PR #46** (synthetic test PR opened during vault-
  credential live verification). Close with
  `gh pr close 46 --repo afarahat-lab/trackeros --delete-branch`.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. The dev-override container restart
  during ADR-023 (apiShape) verification regenerated `master.key`,
  breaking the prior vault secret. Both LLMs are currently in
  env-var mode (`apiKeyEnv: 'LLM_API_KEY'`) and working.
