# BUILD.md — Build status + known issues

## How to run builds

```bash
pnpm -r build                 # build all packages (topological order)
pnpm --filter @gestalt/core typecheck

docker-compose up -d          # postgres + redis + server (production stage)
docker-compose logs -f server
```

## Current build status

| | |
|---|---|
| `pnpm -r build` | ✅ clean (12 packages) |
| `docker-compose up -d` | ✅ healthy (server / postgres / redis) |
| Migrations applied | 023 (latest: `023_llm_api_shape`) |
| Server reachable | `http://localhost:3000/health` returns 200 |
| Dashboard | served at `http://localhost:3000/app/` |

The 12 buildable packages: `@gestalt/core`, `@gestalt/adapter-postgres`,
`@gestalt/adapter-oracle` (stub), `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` (stub),
`@gestalt/agents-generate`, `@gestalt/agents-quality-gate`,
`@gestalt/agents-deploy`, `@gestalt/agents-maintenance`,
`@gestalt/registry`, `@gestalt/server`, `@gestalt/cli`,
`@gestalt/dashboard`.

## Known issues

None blocking the build. Areas to keep in mind:

1. **`UserRepository` / `ProjectRepository` extensions touch every
   adapter.** Adding a method means Oracle + MSSQL stubs must add the
   same method (as throw-stubs is fine). Build will fail until every
   adapter implements the new surface.
2. **CLI pins chalk@4 / ora@5 for CJS compatibility.** Do not upgrade
   either without performing the full ESM migration (`"type":
   "module"`, `.js` extensions on relative imports, Dockerfile
   update). The pin is intentional.
3. **Dashboard bundle 1010 KB raw / 319 KB gzipped** after the
   CodeMirror addition. Above Vite's 500 KB warning. Acceptable for an
   admin-only feature.
4. **LLM model name not validated at startup.** `loadConfig` accepts
   any non-empty string for `LLM_MODEL`. Invalid model surfaces as a
   404 on the first LLM call.

## Pending operator actions

### ADRs 042–049 — Platform/operator split and related principles codified

Documentation-only session. Eight ADRs appended to
`docs/DECISIONS.md`: ADR-042 (LLM guidance prose lives in
HARNESS.json + agents.yaml, never `.ts`), ADR-043 (Aider opt-in
backend), ADR-044 (gpt-4o for gate, gpt-4o-mini for code-gen),
ADR-045 (evidence requirement — every finding needs a
`quotedLine`), ADR-046 (LLM-driven script execution for gate
verification — no hardcoded script commands), ADR-047 (CI/CD
owns runtime verification; gate owns architectural review —
extends ADR-041), ADR-048 (LLM-driven retry routing via
`SelfHealingDiagnosis.retryTaskType`, no hardcoded dispatch
maps), ADR-049 (architecture agent uses phased consultation —
`designFeature()` + `designPhase()` — not single-call full
design). No platform code change; no migrations.

**Operator action:** None. ADRs are read-only contracts the
platform already honours.

### TR_021 — Externalise gate-agent verificationGuidance to HARNESS.json

Refactor: STEP 1-5 verification protocol lifted from
`llm-review-agent.ts` into
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig[role].verificationGuidance`. Platform
mechanics (evidence requirement, severity ceiling, JSON schema,
parser-level dropUnevidencedFindings, ABSOLUTE_MAX_RETRIES) stay
in code. constraint-agent gained the configurable section "for
free" via the shared `renderHarnessAgentRules` helper. Template
bumped 0.6.0 → 0.7.0. Two trackeros cycles deployed
single-round (PR #55 pre-commit no-regression + PR #56
post-commit prompt-render verified). No new migrations.

### TR_020 — First clean github-actions deploy

trackeros's first `Status: ✓ deployed` against the real
`github-actions` adapter: 1m 58s, single round, PR #54
squash-merged. Four fixes: console.log rule scope, retryCount
threading, CI trigger dedupe (3→1), executeScript stripped +
"trust CI" prompt. Template bumped 0.5.0 → 0.6.0.

**Resolved (structurally) by TR_021:**
- ~~LOW — TR_020: extend "trust CI" rule to constraint-agent~~ —
  now a one-line edit to
  `agentConfig['constraint-agent'].verificationGuidance` in
  HARNESS.json; no platform code change required.

### Carryovers (TR_019 / TR_018 / TR_014)

- **MEDIUM — TR_019:** `gestalt init` should scaffold a
  `.gitignore` + align jest/ts-jest/@types/jest versions with
  TypeScript. trackeros's jest@27 + TS@5 mismatch was latent
  under `noop` and only surfaced when CI ran jest.
- **LOW — TR_019:** Template `{{ciSetupSteps}}` for Node/npm
  should include `--legacy-peer-deps` on `npm install` until the
  upstream npm arborist `Link.matches` bug is fixed.
- **LOW — TR_019:** Add a `tsc --noEmit` sanity check on
  scaffolded tests in `gestalt init`.
- **HIGH — TR_018:** Restore TR_010 mandatory `executeScript
  tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on trackeros's HARNESS.json.
- **MEDIUM — TR_014:** Aider token-spend capture. Parse
  `Tokens: N sent / M received` from Aider's stdout and surface
  as `tokens_used` on the execution row.

### Recent trackeros operator commits (already pushed)

- `13223d29` (TR_021) — HARNESS.json `verificationGuidance`
  arrays added to constraint-agent + review-agent blocks.
- `f926e840` (TR_020) — agents.yaml review-agent tools stripped
  + trust-CI prompt extension.
- `99a48c73` (TR_020) — HARNESS.json console.log rewording +
  gestalt.yml pull_request trigger removed.

### Platform state caveats (unchanged)

- **`master.key`** generated locally (workspace root, mode 600,
  gitignored) + mounted into the server container via
  `docker-compose.yml`. Survives `docker compose up -d --build`.
  Back up out-of-band; losing it makes every vault-encrypted
  secret unreadable.
- **Open alerts to dismiss**: prior cycle alerts from
  TR_010–TR_018 (`gestalt alerts list` shows the full set).
  All dismissable with `gestalt alerts dismiss <id>`.
- **Live-verify TEST_REPORT_003 Fix 1** (env-default LLM
  apiShape) by switching `LLM_MODEL=chat-latest` + setting
  `platform_llms.chat-latest.api_shape='responses'` and
  confirming `max_completion_tokens` reaches the wire.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. Both LLMs currently in env-var
  mode (`apiKeyEnv: 'LLM_API_KEY'`) and working.
