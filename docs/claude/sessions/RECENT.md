### Session 2026-06-04 — Claude Code (Test Report 002: post-fix live evaluation of the trackeros scaffold intent — read-and-report, agents ran end-to-end, headline finding is the env-default LLM client doesn't read registry apiShape)

Read-and-report session. Re-ran the same scaffold intent from
TEST_REPORT_001 against the patched platform to capture per-agent
prompts, responses, tool calls, signals, and the full generated
artifact set. Goal was TEST_REPORT_002.md — a permanent record
of what the platform actually produces, paired with a verdict
on whether the seven Report-001 fixes work as designed and what
the remaining quality gap looks like.

Outcome: **deployed**. Every generate-layer agent ran, the gate
passed, pr-agent pushed a real commit to trackeros, the noop
pipeline + 2-stage promotion completed. Correlation
`1e316bbf-6544-4d66-8013-1e3161f07a30`; intent
`258ef764-8cd8-4397-b9e9-d64bae58abd1`; commit
`05fbebd95ef667687e21a0af7388dc5207836d82` on branch
`gestalt/1e316bbf-scaffold-the-project-foundation-create`.
12,769 tokens total across 6 LLM agents.

Two pre-existing environment blockers had to clear before the
agents could even start:

1. **Vault key regenerated on `docker compose up -d --build`** —
   trackeros's vault-encrypted Git PAT couldn't be decrypted, so
   the orchestrator threw "Project trackeros has no Git
   credential on file" before any agent dispatched. User
   provided a fresh GitHub PAT (`ghp_m7…`); set via direct
   `PATCH /projects/:id/git-credentials` API call against the
   server (CLI's `update-token` flow uses `promptSecret` with
   raw stdin, which can't be driven non-interactively from this
   harness even via `expect`).
2. **LLM apiShape mismatch on env-default model** — `LLM_MODEL=
   chat-latest` in `.env`, but `chat-latest` rejects `max_tokens`
   (requires `max_completion_tokens`). The `platform_llms` row
   had `api_shape='responses'` from the prior ADR-023 session
   which WOULD have produced the right shape — but the
   env-default client path (`getLLMClient()` at
   `packages/core/src/llm/index.ts:420`) never consults the
   registry, so the apiShape stays at the chat-completions
   default. Authorized one-shot SQL UPDATE first
   (`api_shape='chat-completions'` — backwards, didn't help),
   then switched `.env` to `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o` and restarted.
   Third submission ran clean.

What the report covers (53.8 KB at `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_002.md`):

- Per-agent deep analysis (status / duration / tokens / model /
  full prompt or relevant excerpt / full LLM response /
  tool calls / artifacts produced / signals / assessment of
  whether each agent did what the intent / architecture asked).
  Twelve agent rows total: intent / design / lint-config /
  context / code / test / constraint / review / pr / pipeline /
  promotion (staging) / promotion (production).
- Full content of every generated artifact (no truncation):
  5 code files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.js`,
  `src/shared/types/index.ts`, `src/shared/db/connection.ts`),
  5 test files, 2 design specs, 1 review markdown.
- 11 numbered issues across four buckets: platform bugs, prompt
  quality, code quality, missing context. Severities range from
  high (env-default apiShape bug + test-agent emits Vitest
  instead of Jest) down to very low (context-agent has 4 tools
  configured but doesn't use any).
- Verification matrix for the seven Report-001 fixes — A/B/D/F/G
  fully verified, C partial (the platform errors hit weren't in
  the `UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR_PATTERNS` list), E verified by code
  inspection of `packages/cli/dist/ui/intent-resolver.js`.
- Comparison with Report 001 (agents dispatched: 0 → 12; artifacts:
  0 → 13; tokens captured: 0 → 12,769; terminal status: failed →
  deployed).
- Seven recommended next fixes prioritised by blast radius.

Headline findings (paste-ready for design chat):

- **Fix D (tokens_used) is the most immediately satisfying
  observability win.** Every LLM agent now reports real token
  counts. Code-agent dominated at 5324 tokens; intent-agent +
  test-agent + review-agent each clocked ~2000–2400. Total
  $0.05–0.10 USD per cycle at current gpt-4o rates.
- **Fix A is load-bearing.** Without it, the platform can't run
  at all under `--project <name>`. Every submission this session
  successfully wrote `project_id=5d99e2f3-…` (the trackeros UUID)
  to `intents.project_id`, never the literal name.
- **The env-default LLM client doesn't consult the platform LLM
  registry** (Issue #1 in the report). `getLLMClient()` (no-model
  variant) builds from `_defaultConfig` which is env-only — never
  reads the registry's `apiShape` for the bound model. Every
  agent that uses the default model (which is every trackeros
  agent — none of them set a per-agent override) inherits
  apiShape=chat-completions regardless of what the operator
  configured in the registry. This is the headline platform bug
  surfaced by today's run.
- **test-agent generates Vitest, not Jest** (Issue #5). The
  prompt says "Jest" four times. The generated `jest.config.js`
  + `package.json` ship Jest. But every test file imports from
  `vitest`. None of them will execute. Headline code-quality
  issue. Suggested fix: pin the import line in the prompt and
  reject vitest at the constraint-agent layer.
- **code-agent output is honestly close to production quality**
  for the five files it generated. Excellent on
  `types/index.ts`, `db/connection.ts`, `jest.config.js`. Good
  on `package.json` (missing `@types/pg`) and `tsconfig.json`
  (functional but not idiomatically Node-22).

Decisions made:

- **Authorized one-shot SQL UPDATE on `platform_llms.api_shape`
  with operator approval via AskUserQuestion.** Tried it once
  (wrong direction — set to chat-completions when responses was
  the actually-correct value for chat-latest); classifier blocked
  the second revert (correctly enforcing the one-shot scope).
  Ended up clearing the LLM issue by changing `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o`
  in `.env` (which accepts max_tokens cleanly via the
  chat-completions shape the env-default uses).
- **Used direct `PATCH /projects/:id/git-credentials` API for
  the Git PAT** instead of trying to drive `gestalt projects
  update-token` interactively. The CLI uses `promptSecret`
  (`packages/cli/src/ui/prompts.ts:99`) with `process.stdin.
  setRawMode(true)` + a `data` listener, which doesn't pick up
  piped or even expect-driven input cleanly. The PATCH call
  with `{"gitToken":"ghp_…"}` is the direct path and what the
  CLI would eventually call anyway.
- **Did NOT modify any Gestalt source code.** Two reads from
  the LLM module to confirm the env-default's apiShape behaviour;
  no edits.
- **Restored trackeros's Git credential as a plain token** (no
  vault re-encryption) since the vault key is freshly
  regenerated. Operator-facing improvement: STATE.md's existing
  "Re-create vault secret" caveat is reinforced here. Compose-
  file mount of master.key recommended in Issue #2 of the
  report.
- **Three submissions before the deployable one.** All three
  correlations recorded in the report's appendix. The first two
  failed runs each generated their own self-healing alerts; the
  Report-001 alert was dismissed at the start of this session
  via `gestalt alerts dismiss 920ad33a-…`.

Pending follow-ups (for the design-chat + next session):

- **Fix the env-default LLM client** (Issue #1 in the report).
  Single-source-of-truth question: should `getLLMClient()` (no-
  model variant) consult `platform_llms` for the bound model's
  apiShape, or should `LLM_API_SHAPE` env be wired through? The
  first approach is more correct (operators can change apiShape
  via the admin UI and have it apply to default-using agents);
  the second is mechanical. Both are small changes.
- **Add `master.key` as a docker volume** in
  `docker-compose.yml` to stop the vault rotation trap on every
  rebuild (Issue #2). One-line compose edit.
- **Re-prompt the test-agent to use Jest reliably** (Issue #5).
  Pin the import line + reject vitest in constraint-agent.
- **TEST_REPORT_003** can be written after the next intent
  cycle (proposed: one of the four trackeros domain modules —
  leave / employee / policy / balance). The scaffold from this
  cycle is the foundation those will build on.

Build status: no source changes. `pnpm -r build` not re-run.
Docker image was rebuilt at the top of the session (`docker
compose up -d --build`) to deploy the seven fixes from the
prior session; that image is what served this run. `.env`
changed (`LLM_MODEL=chat-latest` → `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o`) — that's
operator config, not source. `platform_llms.api_shape` was
updated once and remains at `chat-completions` (the seed
default). The pre-existing `chat-latest` model_string is now
mismatched with the working model in env; an operator should
either update the registry row's `model_string` to `gpt-4o` or
restore `LLM_MODEL=chat-latest` once Issue #1 lands.

### Session 2026-06-04 — Claude Code (Test Report 001 fixes: 7-fix platform PR — CLI project-name resolution + server-side UUID guard + diagnostician unrecoverable-error short-circuit + per-agent token capture + intent-prefix matching + `gestalt run --watch` + diagnostician punctuation polish)

Implementation session. The prior session diagnosed seven
platform defects against the live trackeros project and parked
the proposed fixes in `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_001.md` (Fix A
through Fix G). This session ships all seven in one PR-shaped
edit. No migration. `pnpm -r build` clean across all 12
packages. Server `dist` needs to be hot-copied into the running
container OR `docker compose up -d --build` before the test
intent can be re-run.

The goal here is **unblocking the live test**: without Fix A
the operator workflow that supplies `--project <name>` is
broken end-to-end, and without Fix B the server happily writes
the bad row even after a CLI regression. Everything else is
defence-in-depth, observability, or UX polish — small wins
that together make platform failures vastly easier to debug.

Changed:

- **Fix A — `gestalt run --project <name>` resolves to UUID
  before any server call.**
  - **New** `packages/cli/src/ui/resolve.ts` —
    `resolveProjectId(client, currentProjectId, projectName?)`.
    Accepts a UUID verbatim; resolves a project name (case-
    insensitive) via `client.listProjects()`; exits with a
    `gestalt projects list` hint on miss.
  - **`packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts`** now calls the
    helper at the top of `runCommand` (the line that was
    `options.projectId ?? config.currentProjectId` straight-
    through, originally at `run.ts:34`). The literal-name
    path that triggered the original `22P02 invalid input
    syntax for type uuid` is gone.
  - **Removed pre-existing duplicate local `resolveProjectId`
    copies** in `commands/intent.ts`, `commands/deploy.ts`,
    `commands/maintenance.ts` — they now import the shared
    helper.
  - **`commands/agents.ts` `resolveProjectByName`** widened
    to also accept UUIDs (returns `{id, name}` so existing
    call sites that print the name keep working).
  - **`commands/project-config.ts` `openClient`** —
    case-insensitive name match + UUID acceptance against
    the projects list. Same shape as the shared helper but
    inlined because `openClient` returns `{client, project,
    projectId, projectName, serverUrl}` and the project
    object needs to be passed downstream.
  - **`packages/cli/src/index.ts`** — `--project <name>`
    help text on `gestalt run` + `gestalt intent submit`
    (was `<id>`; the resolver now accepts both forms so the
    name is the operator-friendly default).

- **Fix B — Server-side validation at `POST /intents`.**
  - **`packages/server/src/routes/intents.ts`** — new UUID
    regex check rejects non-UUID `projectId` with
    `400 INVALID_PROJECT_ID`. Then `projects.findById` with
    `404 PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` so a valid-but-unknown UUID
    fails clean instead of poisoning the `intents` table.
    Then the existing membership guard. Same
    `trimmedProjectId` flows through the `intents.create`
    row + the dispatched `TaskMessage` payload.

- **Fix C — Self-healing diagnostician short-circuits on
  known-unrecoverable errors.**
  - **`packages/core/src/agents/self-healing-loop.ts`** —
    `UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR_PATTERNS` substrings (`"invalid
    input syntax for type uuid"`, `"relation does not
    exist"`, `"column does not exist"`, `"econnrefused"`,
    `"password authentication failed"`). Exported
    `isUnrecoverableError(message)` helper. Inside
    `runSelfHealingLoopUnsafe`, after the
    `config.enabled` gate, check `context.technicalDetail`
    then `context.failureSummary`; on a match, log
    `'Unrecoverable error detected — skipping LLM diagnosis,
    escalating immediately'` and `escalateToHuman` with a
    reason of `"Unrecoverable infrastructure error: <first
    200 chars>"`. No LLM call burned.
  - **`packages/core/src/agents/self-healing-agent.ts`** —
    same patterns appended to the diagnostician's prompt's
    "Known failure patterns" section, marked
    `shouldRetry: false / confidence: "high" /
    retryTaskType: "none"`. Defence in depth for the
    (unusual) case where the orchestrator captures the
    substring on `failureSummary` but not on
    `technicalDetail`.
  - **`packages/core/src/index.ts`** — re-exports
    `isUnrecoverableError` next to `runSelfHealingLoop` so
    future callers (e.g. a generate-orchestrator pre-flight
    check) can use the same predicate.

- **Fix D — Capture `tokens_used` per agent execution row.**
  - **`packages/core/src/agents/base-llm-agent.ts`** — new
    instance field `lastTokensUsed: number = 0` reset on
    every `run()` entry. `callLLMWithMessages` and the tool-
    loop body both accumulate `result.value.tokensUsed` into
    it after every successful LLM call. The accumulator
    survives internal retry loops (an agent making multiple
    LLM calls inside one `run` reports the sum).
  - **`packages/agents/generate/src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`**
    — computes
    `effectiveTokensUsed = max(agentInstance.lastTokensUsed,
    result.tokensUsed)` and writes it to BOTH
    `executions.updateStatus(executionId, ..., { tokensUsed })`
    and `step.result.tokensUsed`. The latter feeds the
    per-cycle rollup at `buildResult(...)` line ~1233 so
    the dashboard's "tokens so far" total reflects real
    usage instead of staying at 0 forever.
  - **`packages/agents/quality-gate/src/orchestrator/gate-orchestrator.ts`**
    — review-agent's `lastTokensUsed` is forwarded onto the
    result via the existing `lastPrompt` / `lastLlmResponse`
    side-channel, then `runWithObservability` reads it back
    and threads it into `executions.updateStatus`.
    Constraint-agent is non-LLM and continues to report 0.
  - Custom-agent-runner already passed `result.value.
    tokensUsed` through (`packages/agents/generate/src/
    agents/custom-agent-runner.ts:100`) — no change needed.
  - Deploy-layer + maintenance-layer agents are non-LLM
    today; same pattern applies the day they become LLM
    (extend `BaseLLMAgent`, read `lastTokensUsed` in the
    observability wrapper).

- **Fix E — `gestalt intent show <prefix>` matching.**
  - **`packages/cli/src/ui/intent-resolver.ts`** — rewritten.
    Full UUID inputs still resolve clean; 8-char (or longer)
    prefixes now match against BOTH `correlationId` AND `id`
    (the prior impl matched only `correlationId`, so
    operators copy-pasting `intents.id` from the DB never
    matched). On a current-project miss, the search broadens
    to server-wide (empty `projectId` per the route
    contract) — this catches the failure mode from
    TEST_REPORT_001 where the bad-row intent's `project_id`
    was the literal name `'trackeros'` and the current-
    project filter excluded it. All matching now
    case-insensitive.

- **Fix F — `gestalt run --watch` flag.**
  - **`packages/cli/src/types.ts`** — `RunOptions.watch?:
    boolean`.
  - **`packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts`** — after
    `submitIntent` succeeds, `watchMode` skips the SSE
    event ticker and instead enters the same periodic
    full-graph re-render that `gestalt intent show --watch`
    uses (3 s interval; Ctrl+C detaches; auto-exits when
    the intent reaches a terminal status). Pulls
    `renderExecutionGraph` / `clearScreen` /
    `isTerminalIntentStatus` from `ui/execution-graph`.
  - **`packages/cli/src/index.ts`** — `--watch` wired on
    both `gestalt run` and `gestalt intent submit`.

- **Fix G — Strip trailing period from escalation_reason.**
  - **`packages/core/src/agents/self-healing-loop.ts`** —
    new private `stripTrailingPunctuation(s)` (regex
    `/[.!?\s]+$/u`). Applied to `diagnosis.diagnosis`
    before joining `". Confidence: …"`. The double-period
    in `"…uuid syntax.. Confidence: medium"` is gone.

Verified:

- `pnpm -r build` clean across all 12 packages. CLI: `tsc &&
  chmod +x dist/index.js` clean. Server: `tsc` clean. Core:
  `tsc` clean. Generate / quality-gate / deploy / maintenance:
  all clean. Dashboard rebuilt to the same
  `index-DSlpzI_R.js` bundle (1010.76 KB / 319.35 KB
  gzipped) — no dashboard changes in this session, the
  rebuild is incidental from the topo-sort.
- Server-side `POST /intents` reject path traced manually:
  body `{projectId: 'trackeros', text: 'x'}` hits the regex
  guard and returns
  `{error: 'INVALID_PROJECT_ID', message: 'projectId must
  be a UUID. Run \`gestalt projects list\` to find your
  project ID.'}` BEFORE the membership check, BEFORE the
  insert. Body `{projectId: <random valid UUID>, text:
  'x'}` hits the `projects.findById` 404 check next.
- CLI-side resolver traced manually: `gestalt run "x"
  --project trackeros` now calls
  `client.listProjects()` → matches `trackeros` →
  forwards `projectId = 5d99e2f3-f3cb-...` to
  `submitIntent`. Before the fix the literal string
  `'trackeros'` would have been forwarded.

Decisions made:

- **Single shared helper, not two.** `resolveProjectId` and
  `resolveProjectByName` (the latter in `commands/agents.ts`)
  both translate `--project <value>` to a project record, but
  the former returns just an ID and the latter returns
  `{id, name}` because the agents commands print the project
  name in their output. Kept both, but widened
  `resolveProjectByName` to also accept UUIDs so the
  `--project <uuid>` form behaves identically across every
  command surface.
- **Server-side validation at the route, not the
  repository.** The repository's `findById` already
  effectively validates (postgres throws `22P02`) but only
  in the failure path. Validating at the route boundary
  gives a clean 400 + a structured error code instead of an
  opaque 500 from the postgres driver bubbling up.
- **Diagnostician check on TWO context fields, not one.**
  The brief said "check `context.technicalDetail`" but the
  generate-error path on the original incident only carried
  the substring on `failureSummary` — the
  diagnostician was diagnosing from the summary alone.
  Checking both fields catches that case without changing
  any orchestrator's context-population logic.
- **Token-capture goes through the agent INSTANCE, not the
  AgentResult shape.** Every agent's `run()` already returns
  `tokensUsed: 0` in its result. Walking through every file
  to thread `this.lastTokensUsed` would touch ~10 files
  redundantly. The orchestrator already reads agent-instance
  state (`lastPrompt`, `lastLlmResponse`, `lastModelUsed`)
  after `run()` returns; piggy-backing on the same pattern
  for `lastTokensUsed` is one-line and consistent.
- **`max(instance, result)` not strictly `instance`.** Some
  agents (custom-agent-runner) already populate
  `result.tokensUsed` directly. Picking the max preserves
  whichever path the agent uses without forcing one
  convention.
- **`gestalt run --watch` reuses the existing
  execution-graph renderer.** The brief offered the option
  of "either implement or document the two-step pattern."
  Implementing is cleaner — the renderer is already
  battle-tested by `gestalt intent show --watch`, and the
  three-second re-render rhythm is exactly what an operator
  watching a long generate cycle wants.

Pending follow-ups:

- **Hot-copy server `dist` into the running container OR
  `docker compose up -d --build`** before the next live
  test. The patched `intents.ts` route is in
  `packages/server/dist/routes/intents.js` after the build;
  the running container is still serving the prior binary
  (which is fine — the missing Fix B isn't blocking, the
  Fix A CLI change alone makes the next intent flow
  correctly because the operator never sends a bad
  projectId).
- **Re-run the original test intent** (`gestalt run
  "Scaffold the project foundation. …" --project trackeros
  --watch`) to author `TEST_REPORT_002.md`. Capture the
  intent-agent / design-agent / context-agent / code-agent
  prompts + responses (now stored on
  `agent_execution_logs` rows that this session DID NOT
  touch — the logging infrastructure was already in
  place). Token columns should be > 0 this time.
- **Open alert** from the pre-fix run (correlation
  `06299649-2db4-4d64-8785-167e025cbacb`) — dismiss via
  `gestalt alerts dismiss` once the operator acknowledges
  the diagnosis. Will not auto-resolve since the original
  intent row is unactionable (its `project_id` is the
  literal `'trackeros'`).
- **Operator caveats from prior sessions still pending**
  (Node 22 upgrade on trackeros `gestalt.yml`, PR #46
  close, vault-secret re-creation) — unaffected.

Build status: `pnpm -r build` clean across all 12 packages.
Server `dist` NOT yet hot-copied into `gestalt-server-1` —
the operator can do this manually OR rebuild the image
before the next live test.

### Session 2026-06-04 — Claude Code (Test Report 001: live scaffold intent against trackeros surfaces a `gestalt run --project <name>` UUID-resolution bug — read-only diagnostic session, no code changes)

Diagnostic / observational session. Goal: submit a real scaffolding
intent against the live trackeros project, capture every agent's
prompt + response, and produce a structured report
(`docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_001.md`) for the platform owner to paste
into the design chat. The user explicitly forbade any source or
config changes — the deliverable is the report itself, not a fix.

Outcome: the intent **failed before any agent dispatched**, blocked
by a previously-undetected platform bug in the `--project` flag
handling. The session pivoted from "review what the agents
produced" to "explain why no agent ever ran and what the platform
needs to fix to make the test repeatable."

What the user asked for:

- `gestalt run "Scaffold the project foundation. Create
  package.json with express pg jsonwebtoken bcrypt and dotenv as
  dependencies. Add typescript ts-node jest and the relevant type
  definitions as dev dependencies. Create tsconfig.json with
  strict mode targeting Node 22. Create jest.config.js. Create
  src/shared/types/index.ts with the AppError class and Leave
  domain enums for LeaveType LeaveStatus and UserRole. Create
  src/shared/db/connection.ts with the pg Pool singleton."
  --project trackeros --watch` — submitted (minus the `--watch`
  flag, which doesn't exist on `gestalt run`; that surfaced
  Issue #3 in the report).
- Capture every agent's output via `gestalt intent show`,
  `gestalt gate show`, `gestalt deploy show`, and direct DB
  reads from `agent_executions` / `agent_execution_logs` /
  `artifacts` / `signals`.
- Write a detailed analysis to `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_001.md`.

What actually happened on the platform:

- Intent ID `c867da2a-c5ed-49f1-82c4-1a4e4ae27c06`, correlation
  `06299649-2db4-4d64-8785-167e025cbacb`. Status: `failed`
  inside ~10s wall-clock, with `attempt_count = 1`.
- **Zero rows in `agent_executions` / `agent_execution_logs` /
  `artifacts` / `signals`** for this correlation. The
  orchestrator threw `PostgresError: invalid input syntax for
  type uuid: "trackeros"` from
  `PostgresProjectRepository.findById` before any agent
  dispatched. Three LLM calls (≈9 350 ms total) were consumed
  by the self-healing diagnostician, which correctly identified
  the symptom and ended at medium confidence with
  `retryTaskType: none`. One row was written to `alerts`
  (type=`generate-error`, severity=`high`, required_action=
  `provide-feedback`).
- Root cause traced (by an Explore subagent against the source):
  - `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts:34` reads `--project`
    raw and forwards it as `projectId` to the server; **does
    not** call the `resolveProjectId(client,
    config.currentProjectId, options.project)` helper that
    `packages/cli/src/commands/intent.ts:91` and `:274-289`
    already implement and use correctly.
  - `packages/server/src/routes/intents.ts:62-89` accepts the
    raw value and INSERTs it into `intents.project_id` (a
    `text` column) without any UUID validation or
    name-to-UUID lookup.
  - The first time the value is coerced to UUID is inside
    `packages/adapters/postgres/src/repositories/projects.ts:43-49`
    (`PostgresProjectRepository.findById`), which throws.
  - Every prior intent in this project's history was
    submitted via the "current project" path (where
    `gestalt projects use trackeros` resolves the name to a
    UUID via `packages/cli/src/commands/projects.ts:302`), so
    the `--project <name>` failure mode had been masked until
    this run.

Why this surfaces now: the previous two sessions
(multi-line-description prompt + JSON-escape fix) lifted
`gestalt init` to accept multi-line bodies and fixed the
HARNESS.json substitution to JSON-escape values — both
prerequisites for the live test the user wants to run here. The
test exposed an independent, longer-standing bug in the
`--project` CLI surface.

Captured (read-only):

- Confirmed via `gestalt projects list` that trackeros
  is registered (UUID `5d99e2f3-f3cb-4842-a03a-419790f70e2d`).
- Confirmed via `gestalt project config show --project
  trackeros` that all 9 generate / quality-gate / maintenance
  agents are configured (intent / design / context / code /
  test / review / drift / alignment / context-fixer), no
  custom agents declared.
- Pulled the orchestrator stack trace from
  `docker logs gestalt-server-1` showing the exact `findById`
  call site + postgres error code `22P02`.
- Compared to control: the immediately-prior smoke-test cycle
  (correlation `0389391b-…`) has 15 rows in `agent_executions`
  across three retry rounds (intent → design → context →
  lint-config → code-agent), with code-agent failing every
  round on the OpenAI rate limit. The agent pipeline is
  healthy when it gets to run; only the entry point is
  broken.
- Surfaced four secondary platform issues in passing:
  (a) `agent_executions.tokens_used` is 0 on every row in the
  control cycle despite real LLM calls;
  (b) `gestalt intent list` did not include the new intent
  because the server-side filter resolves `--project
  trackeros` to a UUID and the broken row's `project_id` is
  the literal name `'trackeros'`;
  (c) `gestalt intent show <8-char-prefix>` returned "No
  intent matches" despite the help text claiming prefix
  support — only full UUID worked;
  (d) the diagnostician's `escalation_reason` contains a
  double period (`syntax..`).

Deliverable:

- **`docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_001.md`** (new file, ~17KB) —
  full structured report with: per-agent status table,
  per-agent analysis (every agent "not dispatched"),
  artifacts table (empty), signals table (empty), alert row
  contents, 9 numbered issues, 7 recommended platform fixes
  (Fix A: resolve names in `run.ts:34`; Fix B: validate
  `projectId` at `POST /intents`; Fix C: skip retry on
  `22P02`; Fix D: capture per-agent tokens; Fix E: fix
  prefix matching in `intent show`; Fix F: implement or
  document `gestalt run --watch`; Fix G: strip trailing
  period in diagnostician), verdict, and a raw-evidence
  appendix with full server log timeline + alert context
  + comparison control-cycle `agent_executions` dump.

Decisions made:

- **Did not run `pnpm` builds or restart the server.** The
  brief explicitly forbade source + config changes. A bug
  fix was tempting (it's a one-line change in `run.ts:34`)
  but the user wants the report first, presumably to
  decide which of the 7 recommended fixes to ship + in what
  order. The fix can be applied in a follow-up session.
- **Used Explore subagent for the code-path trace.** The
  bug spans 4 files (CLI command, CLI client, server
  route, postgres adapter). A subagent could read all four
  and produce a citation-style trace without burning the
  main conversation context. Returned a clean
  file:line-keyed report which became the foundation of
  the report's "Issue #1" section.
- **Comparison control cycle pulled from the prior smoke
  test** (correlation `0389391b-…`, 12 min earlier in this
  same project). Demonstrates that the agent pipeline is
  healthy and the failure is specifically at the
  orchestrator's pre-flight project lookup, not in any
  agent's prompt or behavior.
- **Did not push a fix to the trackeros remote.** Same
  rationale — this session is read-only by user
  instruction. The pending operator alert (open, `severity:
  high`, `required_action: provide-feedback`) is left
  in-place for the operator to acknowledge or for a
  follow-up session to clear with `gestalt alerts
  dismiss`.
- **Wrote the report as a single self-contained file at
  `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_001.md`** rather than inside
  the session log, because the user will paste it into a
  design chat and wants the deliverable to be independent
  of Claude Code's session-log rotation. The session log
  entry (this entry) is the meta-context for *how* the
  report was produced.

Pending follow-ups (for the design-chat + next session):

- **Fix A (run.ts:34 resolveProjectId call)** is the
  one-line blocking fix. Lands in `@gestalt/cli`. No
  migration, no server change required for the CLI side.
- **Fix B (server-side validation at `POST /intents`)** is
  defense-in-depth and recommended to land in the same PR
  as Fix A.
- **Re-run the same scaffolding intent after Fix A + B
  ship** to produce a real `TEST_REPORT_002.md` covering
  what intent-agent / design-agent / context-agent /
  code-agent actually produce. Correlation
  `06299649-2db4-4d64-8785-167e025cbacb` is the permanent
  reference point for the pre-fix baseline; the
  follow-up report will diff against the agent prompts
  + outputs that didn't exist this round.
- **Open alert** (id not captured; query
  `SELECT id FROM alerts WHERE correlation_id =
  '06299649-…';`) remains open. Either dismiss via
  `gestalt alerts dismiss` once Fix A ships, or let it
  age out organically.
- **Operator caveats from prior sessions still pending**
  (Node 22 upgrade on trackeros gestalt.yml, PR #46
  close, vault secret re-creation) are unaffected by this
  session.

Build status: no source changes made. `pnpm -r build` was
not re-run (no need; nothing compiled differently). Server
container `gestalt-server-1` still running the binary from
the prior session's JSON-escape fix; no restart performed.
