# PLATFORM.md — Gestalt platform overview

## What this project is

Gestalt is a self-hosted agent-first platform that automates the full Software
Development Lifecycle. It is a TypeScript monorepo using pnpm workspaces.

The platform is built on the same principles it enforces in client projects:
context files guide agents, the harness is a first-class artifact, and every
package has a README.md that is the agent's local orientation document.
