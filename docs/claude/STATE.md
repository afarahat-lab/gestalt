## What is built and verified

### Platform foundations

- All 12 buildable packages compile (`pnpm -r build`).
- `docker-compose up -d` brings server + postgres + redis healthy.
- All 23 migrations apply on first start.
- Server reachable on `http://localhost:3000`; `/health` returns 200;
  protected routes return 401 without a JWT.
- Dashboard SPA served at `/app/*`; shareable deep-link URLs work.
- First-boot bootstrap verified: `gestalt init-admin` → `gestalt login`
  → `/auth/me` returns the user.

### Four SDLC layers (all wired end-to-end)

- **generate** — intent → design → context → lint-config → code → test;
  custom agents in `agents.yaml` interleave via `runs_after`.
- **quality-gate** — constraint-agent (regex) + review-agent (LLM).
  Verdict: `pass` / `fail` (auto-retry) / `escalate` (GP_BREACH).
  Max gate retries: 3.
- **deploy** — pr-agent → pipeline-agent → promotion-agent
  (staging → production). `PipelineAdapter` interface;
  `GitHubActionsAdapter` + `NoOpPipelineAdapter` implemented.
  ADR-034 production-requires-staging enforced. Auto-merge supported
  via `pipeline.autoMerge` in HARNESS.json.
- **maintenance** — drift / alignment / gc / evaluation, scheduled via
  `node-cron`. Context-file intents take a direct-fix path via
  context-fixer (path-guarded to `docs/*` + `AGENTS.md`).
  `MonitoringAdapter` (Prometheus / Datadog / NoOp).

### Identity + auth

- Local auth (non-production only, ADR-025).
- Kerberos / SAML / OIDC providers (ADR-024); `auth.config.json`
  primary source, HARNESS.json `identity` block fallback (ADR-040).
- Two-tier role model: platform roles (`platform-admin` | `user`),
  project roles (`project-admin` | `editor` | `reader`).
- Platform groups for bulk assignment (Brief 1, migration 018);
  effective project role = max of direct + group-derived.
- Server-side membership enforcement on every read + write endpoint;
  no-enumeration-leak rule (empty array, not 403).
- Hot-reload of identity providers without server restart
  (`POST /platform/identity/reload`).

### Platform admin surfaces

- **Users** — CRUD + deactivate + self-protection guards.
- **Projects** — platform-admin create / delete (with active-intents
  guard) / list with cross-project enrichment (members / intents /
  last activity).
- **Groups** — CRUD, members, project assignments with role
  precedence.
- **LLM registry** (migration 014) — per-row baseUrl / apiKeyEnv /
  apiShape (`chat-completions` vs `responses` for gpt-5/o1/o3).
- **Secrets vault** (migrations 015+016) — AES-256-GCM encrypted,
  master key at `/etc/gestalt/master.key` or
  `GESTALT_MASTER_KEY` env; rotation tooling (migration 021).
- **Self-healing** (migration 020) — 7 per-failure-type configs;
  diagnostician picks `retryTaskType` + hints; alerts auto-resolve
  at high confidence.
- **Templates** — harness templates table (migration 017) +
  download / duplicate / edit / push / diff (dashboard + CLI).
  Built-in templates read-only; duplicate first to customise.
- **MCP servers** — platform-wide MCP servers (`platform_mcp_servers`).
- **Self-healing** + **identity** dashboard tabs.

### Project lifecycle

- `gestalt init` registers project; server clones repo, generates
  stack config via LLM (`generateStackConfig`), substitutes
  variables into harness template, commits + pushes.
- Vault-backed Git PATs (migration 022) — operators link a vault
  secret to a project; resolver decrypts server-side per-cycle.
- GitHub repo browser via `/platform/git/repos` proxy.
- Dynamic harness — LLM picks language / framework / package
  manager / test runner at init time.

### Agent infrastructure

- `BaseLLMAgent` in `@gestalt/core/agents` — every LLM-using agent
  in every layer extends it. Captures `lastPrompt` /
  `lastLlmResponse` / `lastModelUsed`.
- Built-in file tools (ADR-038, migration 012): `readFile`,
  `listDirectory`, `searchFiles`, `getFileTree`. Read-only,
  path-traversal-guarded.
- MCP integration (ADR-039) — external tool servers per-agent in
  `agents.yaml`. Namespace prefix prevents collision with built-ins.
- Per-agent LLM model override + tools.builtin + tools.mcp +
  prompt_extensions, all driven by `agents.yaml` in the project repo.
- Custom agents (ADR-037) — prompt-only LLM runners declared by the
  project; topo-sorted via `runs_after`.
- Section-based prompts (architecture / constraints / scope /
  design / intent / principles / domain / signals / task) — every
  LLM-generating agent opens with non-negotiable rules.

### Observability + operator surfaces

- Per-agent `agent_executions` + `agent_execution_logs` rows
  (migration 007 + 009 + 012) with prompt / response / model /
  tool calls.
- Live event bus (`@gestalt/core/events`) → SSE at
  `/events`. Dashboard subscribes for instant updates.
- IntentDetail accordion with prompt + LLM response + tool calls
  + signals + artifacts.
- Active agents card with cycle progress + token totals.
- Deployments view: 4/5-node pipeline timeline (5th node for
  auto-merged cycles).
- Maintenance view: per-run findings expansion panel.
- Alerts: per-type bodies + interventions (ADR-021).
- Pipeline failure alerts with operator feedback → resume on the
  same branch (migration 019).
- Operator-driven CLI parity: `gestalt intent / gate / deploy /
  agents active / maintenance / status --graph --watch`.

### CLI

- Bootstrap: `init-admin`, `login`, `init`, `run`, `status`, `logs`.
- Project: `projects list/use/set-adapter/update-token`;
  `project config show/set-agent/set-pipeline/add-custom-agent/...`
- Alerts: `alerts list/show/fix/dismiss/resume/abort/acknowledge/
  pipeline-feedback`.
- Platform admin (gated to platform-admin): `users`,
  `platform llms / secrets / projects / templates / mcp /
  tools / identity / groups / self-healing`.
- Intent: `intent list/show/submit` with `--watch` + filters
  (`--source`, `--priority`, `--search`, `--from`, `--to`).
- Templates push + diff (added 2026-06-04).

## Implemented with caveats

- **Quality-gate** — `lint-agent` / `security-agent` /
  `test-runner-agent` are stubs (need a `pnpm install` step in the
  cloned tree). The package works end-to-end via
  `constraint-agent` + `llm-review-agent`.
- **Deploy** — `GitHubActionsAdapter` + `NoOpPipelineAdapter` are
  the only implementations. Azure DevOps / GitLab CI / Jenkins
  are typed stubs in the `PipelineAdapterType` union.
- **Maintenance** — `Prometheus` / `Datadog` `MonitoringAdapter`
  implementations exist but aren't yet verified against a real
  monitoring instance. NoOp is the verified path.
- **Identity** — Local + OIDC verified end-to-end via the
  Keycloak fixture. SAML compiles + the route shape is verified
  but full end-to-end against a real IdP only exercised once.
  Kerberos provider compiles; not exercised end-to-end (needs a
  real AD + krb5.keytab).

---

## What is not yet built

- `@gestalt/adapter-oracle` — every repository method throws.
- `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` — every repository method throws.
- `@gestalt/registry` — types + client only; no server, no UI.
- Non-GitHub `PipelineAdapter` impls (Azure DevOps / GitLab CI /
  Jenkins).
- GitLab / Azure DevOps / Bitbucket support in
  `/platform/git/repos` (GitHub only today).
- LDAP group lookup for Kerberos identities (Kerberos tickets
  carry user only; groups need AD query).

---

## Active follow-ups (small)

- **Dashboard bundle is 1010 KB raw / 319 KB gzipped** after the
  CodeMirror addition (2026-06-04). Above Vite's 500 KB warning.
  Future code-split via dynamic `import()` would restore the
  main bundle to ~370 KB.
- **Retry cycle full re-runs all generate agents** even though
  only routed agents need fresh work. Skipping intent/design/
  context when prior artifacts are present in the Git tip would
  speed retries by ~30 s.
- **`qualityGate.maxRetries` hardcoded to 3** in both gate and
  generate orchestrators; reading it per-project from
  HARNESS.json is a small follow-up.
- **Promotion workflow dispatches against a hardcoded `'main'`
  ref.** Projects on `master` / `trunk` will see promotion
  workflow-dispatch fail. Thread `project.defaultBranch` through.
- **No proactive PAT-scope validation at registration /
  set-adapter time.** A PAT missing `workflow` scope only
  surfaces on the first pipeline dispatch.
- **Return-URL preservation across login.** Pasting
  `/app/intents/<id>` in a fresh tab bounces to `/app/login`
  then lands on `/app/` (intent ID dropped).
- **Vite dev-server proxy `/api` entry is dead** — server has
  no routes under `/api`. Pre-existing dead config; remove on
  next dashboard touch.
- **Encrypt Git PATs at rest in the legacy
  `project_git_credentials` table.** Vault path is the modern
  flow; legacy plain-token path still has the TODO comment.
- **LLM model name not validated at startup** — an invalid model
  only surfaces as a 404 on the first LLM call.
- **HA replica support for OIDC state.** Today's state is
  in-memory; multi-replica deployments would need Redis-backed
  state so the callback can hit a different replica than the
  login.

## Operator caveats / pending actions

- **trackeros `.github/workflows/gestalt.yml`** still pins Node
  20 (project bootstrapped before the 2026-06-04 Node 22 LTS
  template change). Edit `node-version: '20'` → `'22'` + commit
  manually. Non-breaking — Node 20 still works.
- **trackeros PR #46** — synthetic test PR opened during
  vault-credential live verification (2026-06-04). Close with
  `gh pr close 46 --repo afarahat-lab/trackeros --delete-branch`.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. The dev-override container restart
  during ADR-023 (apiShape) verification regenerated
  `master.key`, breaking the prior vault secret. Both LLMs are
  currently in env-var mode and working.

## CLI install

`@gestalt/cli` is private — not on npm.
```bash
pnpm --filter @gestalt/cli build && cd packages/cli && npm link
```

---

## First-boot sequence

1. `docker-compose up -d` — start platform.
2. `gestalt init-admin` — create admin user (TTY only, once
   per server).
3. `gestalt login` — authenticate CLI.
4. `mkdir my-project && cd my-project && git init && git remote
   add origin <url>`.
5. `gestalt init` — register project + server pushes harness.
6. `git pull` — receive harness files locally.
7. `gestalt run "<intent>"` — submit work to agents.
