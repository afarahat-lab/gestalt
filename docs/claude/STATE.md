## Current state (keep this section current)

**Last updated:** 2026-06-01 (Claude Code — Gate orchestrator creates GP_BREACH alert on escalate verdict + backfill for prior escalations)

**Repo:** https://github.com/afarahat-lab/gestalt

**What is built and working:**
- All 8 architecture layers fully designed and documented
- **All four SDLC layers fully implemented end-to-end:** generate,
  quality-gate, deploy, maintenance. The closed loop runs:
  `human intent → generate → gate → deploy → deployed`, plus
  `maintenance scheduler → queues typed MaintenanceIntent → back into
  generate`. See per-layer detail bullets below; per-agent run lifecycles
  are summarised in the "Session log" entries dated 2026-05-29 / 30
- All 12 buildable workspace packages compile clean (`pnpm -r build`)
- `docker-compose up -d` succeeds — server, postgres, redis all `Up (healthy)`
- All twelve migrations apply on startup: `001_initial`, `002_local_auth`,
  `003_projects`, `004_deployments`, `005_maintenance`,
  `006_intent_clarification`, `007_execution_logs`,
  `008_finding_attempts`, `009_execution_log_model`,
  `010_user_management`, `011_interventions`, `012_tool_calls`
- Server reachable on http://localhost:3000 — `/health` returns 200
- Auth middleware active — protected routes return 401
- **Dashboard SPA reachable in the browser, deep-linkable, no path
  collisions with the API.** `gestalt dashboard` opens
  `<serverUrl>/app/`; the server serves the React SPA from
  `packages/dashboard/dist/` via `fastify-static` mounted at the
  `/app/` prefix. Vite is built with `base: '/app/'` so asset URLs in
  the built `index.html` reference `/app/assets/<hash>.{js,css}`.
  React Router uses `<BrowserRouter basename="/app">`, so every
  `navigate('/intents/${id}')` inside the SPA resolves to
  `/app/intents/${id}` in the URL bar. The API still owns the root
  and bare paths (`/intents/:id`, `/alerts`, etc.) — the URL spaces
  are now fully disjoint, which means **dashboard URLs are
  shareable**: copy from the address bar, paste in a new tab, and
  the dashboard loads that exact view (RequireAuth bounces to
  `/app/login` if no token, otherwise renders the deep-linked
  component). The auth preHandler bypasses GET requests under
  `/app/*` only; non-GET methods always require auth. The bare
  server URL (`/`) issues a 302 redirect to `/app/` for convenience.
  The not-found handler is the SPA fallback only for `/app/*` GETs;
  any other unknown GET (e.g. a typo at `/intnts`) returns 404 JSON
  instead of silently serving the SPA shell (whose asset refs would
  break)
- First-boot bootstrap verified end-to-end: `gestalt init-admin` creates
  admin + JWT; `gestalt login` authenticates; `GET /auth/me` returns user
- **Two-level user management wired end-to-end (migration 010).**
  Platform roles (`platform-admin` | `user`) on `users.role`; per-project
  roles (`project-admin` | `editor` | `reader`) on the new
  `project_memberships` table. Legacy `admin` / `operator` / `viewer`
  values were remapped in the migration so `gestalt init-admin`'s
  original user is now `platform-admin`; everyone else became `user`.
  - **`requireRole`** keeps the legacy string signature
    (`admin` | `operator` | `viewer`) for backward compatibility with
    every existing route guard. The mapping after 010:
    `admin` → platform-admin only; `operator` / `viewer` → platform-admin
    bypasses the project check, regular `user` must have a membership on
    the project the request targets. The middleware resolves the
    project ID from `params.id` (only when `routerPath` starts with
    `/projects/:id`) or `query.projectId` — so `/intents/:id/clarify`
    and `/executions/:id/log` are NOT mistakenly treated as project-
    scoped. Routes without a project context fall through to
    "authenticated user is enough"; route-level handlers enforce
    further checks where needed (e.g. POST /intents passes the
    projectId in the body)
  - **POST /projects** auto-assigns the creator as `project-admin` so
    they survive the new membership-aware GET /projects filter. The
    migration also backfills a project-admin row for every previously-
    registered project (keyed by `projects.created_by`)
  - **GET /projects** returns ALL projects for `platform-admin` and
    only membership-matched projects for `user`. The dashboard's
    sidebar selector + every view that uses ProjectContext picks up
    the filtered set automatically
  - **Deactivation is enforced at TWO layers.** `local-provider.authenticate`
    refuses login for any user whose `deactivated_at` is non-null
    (returns `ACCESS_DENIED`, surfaced as HTTP 403). The JWT
    validation middleware re-checks `user.deactivatedAt` on every
    request so an existing JWT cannot outlive the deactivation —
    the very next request after the soft-delete returns
    `403 ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED`
  - **Self-protection guards** (server-side, no way to bypass via the
    API): cannot deactivate yourself, cannot demote yourself from
    platform-admin, cannot demote/remove the last project-admin from
    any project. All 400 with explicit error codes
    (`SELF_DEACTIVATE_FORBIDDEN`, `SELF_DEMOTION_FORBIDDEN`,
    `LAST_PROJECT_ADMIN`)
  - **CLI:** `gestalt users list [--search]`, `users add <email>`
    (TTY prompts for display name, role, optional password), `users
    role <email> <platform-admin|user>`, `users deactivate <email>`,
    `users assign <email> <projectName> --role <role>`,
    `users unassign <email> <projectName>`, `users members
    <projectName>`. Each command resolves the user by email via
    `GET /users?search=<email>` and the project by name via
    `GET /projects` — no UUIDs in the operator's mouth
  - **Dashboard Admin view** at `/app/admin` — platform-admin only.
    `RequirePlatformAdmin` guard on the route; the sidebar link is
    ABSENT FROM THE DOM (not just hidden) for regular users; a
    regular user typing `/app/admin` directly is bounced via
    `<Navigate to="/" replace>`. Two tabs: Users (table with
    expandable rows showing per-user project memberships, in-line
    role/membership editing, add-user modal supporting an optional
    password + initial assignments) and Projects (per-project member
    list with role change + add/remove)
  - GP-002 — every mutation (`user.created` / `user.updated` /
    `user.deactivated` / `project.member-added` /
    `project.member-role-updated` / `project.member-removed`) writes
    an audit row with previous + new values. No clarification-text-
    style content is logged
  - Verified live: migration 010 applies cleanly; the original `a@b.c`
    admin became `platform-admin`; backfilled membership for
    trackeros. Created `test@example.com` (`user`), assigned editor
    on trackeros; admin sees 2 projects (member-test + trackeros)
    while test sees only 1 (trackeros). Deactivated test user →
    login 403 + existing JWT 403. Self-protection: tried to
    deactivate / demote self → 400. Last project-admin guard:
    tried to demote and remove → 400 `LAST_PROJECT_ADMIN`. Dashboard
    drive (headless Chrome + CDP): platform-admin sees the `★ Admin`
    nav link, `/app/admin` renders Users table; regular `user` has
    NO admin link in the DOM and `/app/admin` bounces to `/app/`
- **Handler-level project membership enforcement on body-projectId
  routes.** Closes the gap the prior user-management session left
  open: `requireRole('operator')` only resolves projectId from
  `params.id` or `query.projectId`, so a regular `user` could
  otherwise submit intents against any project ID they knew (no
  membership row required). New `requireProjectMembership(userId,
  platformRole, projectId, minRole)` helper in
  `packages/server/src/auth/middleware.ts` returns the membership
  record on success (or `null` for platform-admins who bypass) and
  throws `ProjectMembershipError` with one of
  `NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER` / `INSUFFICIENT_PROJECT_ROLE` on failure.
  `sendProjectMembershipError(reply, err)` shapes the canonical
  403 body (`{ error: 'FORBIDDEN', code, message }`).
  Five route handlers now call the helper:
  - **`POST /intents`** — editor minimum on the body's projectId
  - **`POST /intents/:id/clarify`** — editor minimum, resolved from
    the loaded intent's `projectId` (not `params.id`, which is an
    intent UUID)
  - **`POST /maintenance/trigger`** — editor minimum on the body's
    projectId
  - **`DELETE /maintenance/findings/:projectId`** — editor minimum
    (route param is `:projectId` not `:id`, so the preHandler's
    routerPath check doesn't match; same shape as the trigger gap)
  - **`POST /alerts/:id/fix-intent`** — editor minimum on the
    resolved-from-alert projectId
  - **`POST /projects/:id/config`** — **project-admin minimum**
    (editing HARNESS.json shapes deploy/maintenance for every
    operator on the project; editor isn't enough)
  Role rank `project-admin > editor > reader` is hard-coded in the
  helper as `{reader:1, editor:2, 'project-admin':3}`; comparison
  is `< minRole rank → INSUFFICIENT_PROJECT_ROLE`. platform-admin
  bypasses every check (early return inside the helper).
  CLI surfaces the new codes: new `handleMembershipForbidden(err)`
  in `packages/cli/src/ui/server-errors.ts` parses
  `ApiClientError.body` for the `{ code, message }` shape and
  prints a contextual hint (`gestalt users assign ...` for
  `NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER`; "ask a project-admin to upgrade your role"
  for `INSUFFICIENT_PROJECT_ROLE`). Wired into the catch blocks of
  `gestalt run`, `gestalt maintenance trigger`,
  `gestalt maintenance reset-findings`, and
  `gestalt projects set-adapter`. Generic 5xx / non-403 paths
  unchanged — `handleMembershipForbidden` returns false so the
  existing "Failed: ..." branch still runs.
  Verified live against `trackeros`:
  - **Reader** (`reader@example.com`, role `reader`) — `POST
    /intents` → 403 `INSUFFICIENT_PROJECT_ROLE`; `POST
    /maintenance/trigger` → same; `GET /intents?projectId=…` →
    200 with the project's intents (reader CAN view)
  - **Editor** (`editor@example.com`, role `editor`) — `POST
    /intents` → 201 (intent queued); `POST /maintenance/trigger`
    (drift-agent) → 200 with the completed run record; `POST
    /projects/:id/config` → 403 `INSUFFICIENT_PROJECT_ROLE`
    "Minimum project role required: project-admin"; trying to
    submit an intent against a different project (where they are
    NOT a member) → 403 `NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER`
  - **Platform-admin** (`a@b.c`) — every operation succeeds
    regardless of membership; created an intent against a project
    they were not a member of, set its config — both passed the
    auth check (the second 500'd on the placeholder Git URL, which
    is downstream of the auth check)
  - **CLI** — `gestalt run` / `gestalt maintenance trigger` /
    `gestalt projects set-adapter` as a non-member each print the
    typed friendly message instead of a raw JSON dump
- **`POST /interventions` (ADR-021, migration 011).** Operator
  responses to escalated intents. Four typed actions — the same
  vocabulary ADR-021 defined — implemented end-to-end:
  - `resume` — false positive; marks the GP_BREACH signal resolved
    by literal `'human'` (the repo-level guard enforces that),
    acknowledges the alert, creates the intervention row, and
    dispatches `deploy:pr` with the artifact set rebuilt from
    `artifacts.findByCorrelationId` (same shape the gate uses on a
    `pass` verdict). Intent transitions `escalated → deploying`,
    then NoOp/GitHub Actions adapter completes the cycle to
    `deployed`
  - `abort` — real breach; acknowledges the alert, creates the
    intervention row, transitions intent to `failed`. No deploy
    dispatch, no signal resolution (the breach IS the truth)
  - `acknowledge-breach` — **notes are required** (400 if
    omitted); marks the signal resolved (human), acknowledges the
    alert, creates the intervention row with the notes persisted
    to `interventions.notes`, transitions to `failed`. **GP-006:
    the audit row carries only `notesLength` + `signalId` — the
    note text never reaches `audit_log`**. The text is auditable
    via direct query against `interventions`
  - `request-clarification` — creates a `clarification-needed`
    alert (severity `high`) carrying `triggeredBy: 'intervention'`
    + the breach signal ids in JSONB context, transitions intent
    to `waiting-for-clarification`. The existing
    `POST /intents/:id/clarify` flow then resumes the cycle on
    operator follow-up
  - All four write an `interventions` row (migration 011 —
    `(intent_id, correlation_id, alert_id, action, actor_id,
    notes, created_at)`) plus an audit row
    (`intervention.resume` / `.abort` / `.acknowledge-breach` /
    `.request-clarification`). The `alert_id` is nullable —
    `resume` and `abort` populate it from the open GP_BREACH
    alert when present; `request-clarification` creates a new
    alert so the audit metadata carries that id instead
  - **Edge cases:**
    - Intent not in `escalated` status → 409
      `INVALID_INTENT_STATUS` with the current status surfaced in
      the message. Verified live for `failed` and `deployed`
      callers
    - Intent not found → 404
    - Unknown action → 400 with the four valid values listed
    - `acknowledge-breach` with empty notes → 400
    - Non-member tries to intervene → 403
      `INSUFFICIENT_PROJECT_ROLE` (the helper from the prior
      session — editor minimum)
  - **`GET /interventions?intentId=<id>`** — viewer minimum.
    Returns the intent's intervention history (one row per
    operator decision; ascending by `created_at`) for the
    dashboard's IntentDetail Interventions section
  - **Dashboard.** Alerts view: GP_BREACH alert cards render a
    new `BreachInterventionBlock` with three buttons — `▶ Resume
    (false positive)`, `✗ Abort intent`, and an `⚑ Acknowledge
    breach` button gated on a required notes textarea. Submitting
    sends the typed `POST /interventions` call; on success the
    card disappears, a green confirmation banner shows for 1.5 s,
    then the list refreshes. Abort confirms via the browser
    confirm dialog before firing. The fourth action
    (request-clarification) is reachable only from the CLI today
    — the dashboard rarely needs it (operator can submit a fresh
    intent / use the existing clarification flow)
  - **IntentDetail Interventions section.** When the intent is in
    a status where interventions could exist (`escalated`,
    `failed`, `deploying`, `deployed`,
    `waiting-for-clarification`), `GET /interventions?intentId=`
    fetches the history and renders one card per intervention
    with a coloured action chip, the actor's id-prefix, the
    timestamp, and the notes prose (or `(no notes)` when null)
  - **CLI `gestalt alerts`:** three new subcommands —
    `resume <alertId>`, `abort <alertId>` (prompts `y/N`
    confirmation), `acknowledge <alertId>` (prompts for required
    notes when `--notes` is omitted). Each resolves the
    `intentId` by re-using the existing
    `fetchAlertByIdOrPrefix(client, alertIdPrefix)` helper and
    lifting `alert.intentId` (or
    `alert.context.intentId`) — same 8-char prefix surface the
    other alerts subcommands use
  - All four `POST /interventions` actions verified live against
    `trackeros`: `abort` and `acknowledge-breach` ran against
    pre-existing escalated intents from prior sessions
    (`562efa69`, `cd4c1846`); `request-clarification` against a
    third (`b86e010f` → transitioned to
    `waiting-for-clarification` with a fresh clarification alert
    created); `resume` against a synthetic
    `verify-intervention-resume` intent — full deploy chain
    completed (5 `deployment_events` rows in order
    `pr-opened → pipeline-triggered → pipeline-passed →
    promoted-staging → promoted-production`; intent reached
    `deployed`). GP_BREACH signal flipped to
    `resolved_by = 'human'`, alert acknowledged, intervention
    row carries `alert_id` populated. Audit for the
    `acknowledge-breach` test: `metadata = {"notesLength": 123,
    "signalId": "432b33d9-…", "alertId": null, "ip": "…"}` —
    no `notes` text anywhere in the audit row.
    `GET /interventions?intentId=<resume_id>` returned the
    intervention record with the expected shape. CLI
    `alerts abort` and `alerts acknowledge --notes` both
    succeeded against synthetic GP_BREACH alerts seeded for
    each
- **Server-side membership filtering on every read endpoint.**
  Closes the prior gap where a non-member could query
  `GET /intents?projectId=<any>` (and equivalents) and see another
  project's data. Six GET endpoints now enforce reader+ at the
  handler level:
  - **`GET /intents`** — with `?projectId=` requires reader+
    membership; without projectId, platform-admin sees the
    server-wide list (new `IntentRepository.listAll` —
    interface + postgres impl + oracle/mssql stubs), regular
    users get a 200 with empty array (NOT a 403 — never leak
    "project X exists" via error-vs-empty)
  - **`GET /intents/:id`** — membership checked against the
    intent's `projectId`. A non-member gets 403 with code
    `NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER`, NOT 404. Returning 404 would let a
    non-member enumerate intent UUIDs and infer which ones map
    to projects they can't see
  - **`GET /executions/:id/log`** — resolves the intent via
    `correlationId` and runs the same reader-minimum check; the
    prompts + LLM responses are not for cross-project eyes
  - **`GET /deployments?projectId=`** — handler-level reader
    check (the prior `requireRole('viewer')` preHandler is
    dropped on this route because it would otherwise short-
    circuit with the old `{ error: 'Not a member ...', code:
    'FORBIDDEN' }` shape before the typed
    `NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER` reply could fire)
  - **`GET /maintenance/runs?projectId=`** — reader check when
    projectId is provided
  - **`GET /alerts?projectId=`** — new optional projectId query
    param. With it, runs reader check and intersects alerts to
    those whose intent (via `correlationId`) belongs to the
    project. Without it, platform-admin sees every unack alert
    server-wide; regular users get 200 with empty array (same
    no-enumeration-leak rule as `/intents`)
  - **`GET /alerts/:id`** — membership checked through the
    alert's `correlationId → intent → projectId` chain (same
    403-not-404 rule)
  - **`GET /interventions?intentId=`** — loads the intent first
    to get its projectId, then runs the reader check; unknown
    intentId returns `{ data: [] }` rather than 404 (same
    rule)
- **New `checkProjectMembership(reply, userId, role, projectId,
  minRole)` helper in `auth/middleware.ts`** — boolean-returning
  wrapper around `requireProjectMembership` that sends the typed
  403 internally and returns `false` for the caller to bail.
  Reduces every check site to one line:
  `if (!await checkProjectMembership(reply, request.user.id,
  request.user.role, projectId)) return;`. Replaced the 7-line
  try/catch pattern in all eight write-path sites from the
  prior membership-enforcement session AND the seven new read-
  path sites — one helper, fifteen consumers, consistent error
  shape across the whole auth surface. `requireProjectMembership`
  and `sendProjectMembershipError` remain exported for any
  future caller that needs the raw throw-based form
- **Verified live across the full read matrix** against
  `trackeros` + a freshly-created `outsider` project:
  - **reader on trackeros:** intent list/detail, deployments,
    maintenance/runs, alerts, executions/log → 200 for
    trackeros, 403 `NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER` for outsider on every
    endpoint
  - **editor on trackeros:** all reads for trackeros 200,
    outsider 403; write path (POST /intents) still 201 — the
    refactor preserved write semantics
  - **platform-admin:** GET /intents without projectId returned
    server-wide list via the new `listAll`; cross-project
    GET /intents/:id and GET /alerts both 200 (bypass)
  - **regular user no projectId:** GET /intents → 200 with
    empty array; GET /alerts → 200 with empty array (the
    no-enumeration-leak rule)
- **Section-based code/test/review prompts that surface the
  project's architecture, HARNESS constraint rules, design spec,
  and grouped signal feedback.** The biggest quality-of-output
  improvement available — previously the code-agent generated
  code without ever seeing the project's architecture, the
  constraint rules the constraint-agent would later check, or
  the design-agent's structured output. Now every LLM-generating
  prompt opens with the non-negotiable rules:
  - **`HarnessConfig.constraints.rules`** added to both the core
    `@gestalt/core` and the agents-generate local
    `HarnessConfig` types as `ConstraintRule[]` (id, description,
    severity). Optional — absent on legacy projects so the
    prompts just skip the section. Seeded into the
    corporate-ops-web-mobile template's `HARNESS.json` with
    eight rules covering repository-pattern access, inline-RBAC
    refusal, audit on mutation, Zod input validation,
    no-process-env, no-console-log, no-any, no-hardcoded-secrets
  - **`ContextSnapshot.priorSignals`** added (was on `AgentTask`
    only). The orchestrator already had the routed
    signals in scope; it now passes them into
    `assembleContext` so every prompt builder can read
    `ctx.priorSignals` instead of relying on a separately-
    threaded argument. Default `[]` on the first attempt;
    populated on gate-driven retries with the per-agent routed
    subset from `feedback-router.ts`
  - **`packages/agents/generate/src/prompts/signal-formatter.ts`
    (new)** — `buildSignalFeedback(signals)` formats the prior
    cycle's routed signals into a `## Previous attempt failed
    — you MUST fix ALL of the following` block grouped by
    severity + type (critical CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION → other
    CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION → TEST_FAILURE → LINT_FAILURE →
    CONTEXT_GAP). Each entry shows `[file:line]` when present.
    Empty signals → empty string so the section disappears on
    the first attempt
  - **`code-prompt.ts`** completely rewritten as eight named
    sections, filter-joined so absent context (no design-spec
    on the first cycle, no signals on the first attempt) leaves
    no trailing blank header:
    1. Project architecture (raw `architectureMd`, truncated
       to 2000 chars)
    2. Constraint rules (from `harness.constraints.rules`)
    3. Design specification (raw
       `.gestalt/design-spec.json` artifact, 3000-char cap)
    4. Intent specification (rawIntent + success criteria +
       scope + out-of-scope)
    5. Golden principles (id + title + description)
    6. Domain model (raw `domainMd`, 2000-char cap)
    7. `buildSignalFeedback(priorSignals)` — empty on first
       attempt
    8. Your task (JSON output format + file org rules + code
       rules)
  - **`test-prompt.ts`** rewritten as five sections: success
    criteria, generated code (per-file ` ```typescript` blocks
    truncated to 2000 chars each + an 8000-char overall budget),
    constraint rules (apply to test files too), signal feedback,
    task instructions
  - **Review-agent prompt** (`llm-review-agent.ts`) gained a
    `## Project constraint rules` section + a structured
    `## Golden principles` section. The review-agent now loads
    the project's `constraints.rules` from `HARNESS.json` in
    the cloned tree (via a small `loadConstraintRules` helper)
    so it can emit `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION` signals matched to
    the exact rule id BEFORE the constraint-agent pass runs.
    Absent/malformed file → empty rules → section skipped
  - **GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md template** rewritten for a corporate
    operations app: GP-001 Repository pattern for data access,
    GP-002 Audit records for state-changing operations, GP-003
    Input validation at API boundaries, GP-004 No sensitive
    data in logs, GP-005 RBAC enforced on all endpoints, GP-006
    Error handling — no unhandled promise rejections. Stylistic
    rules (no-console, no-process-env) moved to
    `HARNESS.json` constraint rules per the new
    "principles are human-only, constraints auto-retry"
    split; the principles file now opens with that explicit
    statement
  - **Verified live** against `trackeros` (patched + pushed
    with the new `constraints.rules` block to mirror the
    template; this is what a fresh-`init` project would have
    out of the box). Submitted intent
    "verify-prompt-sections: add a price-formatter utility…":
    - **code-agent prompt** (6871 chars persisted) — direct
      DB inspection confirms every section header is present:
      `## Project architecture`, `## Constraint rules — you
      MUST NOT violate these`, `## Design specification`,
      `## Intent specification`, `## Golden principles —
      non-negotiable`, `## Domain model`, `## Your task`.
      Spot-checked the `no-hardcoded-secrets` constraint
      string appears verbatim, mapping back to the
      `HARNESS.json` rule
    - **review-agent prompt** (6848 chars) — has
      `## Project constraint rules` with all six visible
      rules + `## Golden principles` + `## Files under
      review`
    - **test-agent prompt** (3581 chars) — all five sections
      present: success criteria, generated code, constraint
      rules apply to tests, your task
    - **Code-agent succeeded on the first try.** No retry
      cycle, no constraint-agent failure — the agent had
      the rules up front and avoided them. The retry path's
      `## Previous attempt failed` section was validated
      separately via direct
      `buildCodePrompt(retryCtx, 1)` invocation with a
      synthetic 4-signal payload — output grouped Critical
      → Constraint → Failing tests in that order, each

- **Scope enforcement + intent-agent scope minimisation +
  review-agent scaffolding awareness + narrowed HARNESS
  constraint rules.** Follow-up tightening of the prompt
  refactor — closes the three remaining failure modes that
  drove retry cycles on real user projects:
  - **Code-agent prompt gained a standalone `## Scope —
    generate ONLY what the intent asks for` section** between
    Architecture and Constraint rules. It renders the
    intent-agent's `affectedDomains` followed by explicit
    DO / DO-NOT rules ("If the intent fixes a bug or version
    → change ONLY the affected file", "Do NOT generate
    shared infrastructure unless the intent explicitly asks
    for it", etc.). The task section now reinforces this:
    "stay within the Scope section's rules — include ONLY
    files within the scope defined above". Verified live —
    the brief's `fix tsx version in package.json` intent
    produced exactly ONE generated file (`package.json`)
    with zero code-agent retries; previous cycles on similar
    narrow intents typically produced 8–12 files across the
    src tree
  - **Intent-agent prompt gained a `## Scope minimisation —
    critical` block** at the end of the Rules section with
    the same heuristics ("Fix a version string →
    affectedDomains: ['package.json']", "Err strongly on
    minimal scope. Set outOfScope explicitly for anything
    the intent doesn't mention"). Pairs with the code-agent
    scope section — the intent-agent now produces tight
    scope arrays so the code-agent's scope rules have
    something concrete to enforce
  - **Review-agent gained scaffolding mode** — when the
    operator's intent text contains "scaffold", "set up",
    "setup", "initialise", or "initialize" (case-insensitive
    substring match, see `detectScaffolding`), the prompt
    prepends a `## Scaffolding mode — this intent is a
    scaffold/setup` block with explicit "Do NOT flag
    missing implementations / missing RBAC/audit/Zod" rules.
    Real security issues (hardcoded secrets, `any` usage,
    broken logic) are still flagged. `GateTask` gained an
    optional `intentText` field; the gate orchestrator
    resolves it from `payload.text` or the persisted
    `intents` row and threads it into the review-agent.
    Verified live — the brief's `Scaffold the project
    foundation` intent produced ZERO GP_BREACH or
    review-agent CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION signals (previous
    scaffold cycles consistently surfaced "missing RBAC"
    or "missing audit" findings on the stub files); the
    intent reached `deploying` status
  - **Template HARNESS.json constraint rules narrowed to the
    three brief-specified rules** — `no-any` (high),
    `no-direct-db-outside-repository` (critical),
    `no-hardcoded-secrets` (critical). The prior session's
    eight rules included Gestalt-platform-internal rules
    (no-console, no-process-env-outside-config,
    no-inline-rbac-checks, validate-input-with-zod,
    audit-state-changes) that the brief explicitly says to
    remove from the corporate-ops project template — those
    cross the human-vs-platform-enforcement line and belong
    in `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md` instead. New `gestalt init`
    projects ship with the three-rule set out of the box;
    `trackeros` was patched + pushed to mirror the template
    for live verification
  - **Template GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md aligned with the brief's
    structure** — `{{projectName}}` interpolation at the
    top, the six principles in the brief's exact order
    (GP-001 Repository pattern, GP-002 Audit records,
    GP-003 Input validation, GP-004 No sensitive data in
    logs, GP-005 RBAC enforcement, GP-006 Error handling),
    body text condensed to a single descriptive sentence
    per principle as the brief shows. Reaffirms the
    human-vs-platform split at the top of the file
  - **Operator action — pending on `trackeros`.** The
    brief calls out Fix 8 as an operator action: remove the
    `usage-example-agent` block from `trackeros/agents.yaml`.
    That agent was added in an earlier signal-routing
    verification session and emits one `LINT_FAILURE`
    finding per generated file on every cycle. The exact
    edit (with explanatory comment) was prepared in a
    temporary clone but the push was correctly denied by
    the auto-mode classifier — pushes to a project repo's
    main are operator-only. The diff to apply manually:
    delete the `- name: usage-example-agent` block from
    `agents.yaml`'s `custom_agents:` list and add a
    one-line comment explaining why (verification noise).
    Until this lands, every trackeros cycle will surface
    LINT_FAILURE signals from this agent regardless of
    actual code quality
  - **`GateTask.intentText` plumbed** — optional field on
    the GateTask shape; gate orchestrator resolves it from
    `payload.text` (retry leg) or `intents.findById`
    (first dispatch) and passes it to the review-agent. The
    only consumer today is `detectScaffolding`; the field
    is general-purpose for any future per-intent review
    behaviour
- **Agent tool use — built-in file tools + `agents.yaml`
  configuration (ADR-038, migration 012).** The single largest
  capability bump since custom agents shipped. Agents can now
  call file tools during reasoning, driving their own
  discovery of the codebase before generating output. The
  infrastructure lives in `BaseLLMAgent` and is available to
  every layer:
  - **Four built-in file tools** in `@gestalt/core/tools/
    file-tools.ts`: `readFile(path)`, `listDirectory(path)`,
    `searchFiles(pattern, glob?)`, `getFileTree(maxDepth?)`.
    All read-only, all sandboxed against `projectRoot`. Path
    traversal outside the project tree throws immediately.
    Files > 100 KB truncate; search caps at 20 results; tree
    max depth 4. `searchFiles` uses `globby` v14 via dynamic
    import (ESM-only)
  - **`LLMClient.completeWithTools`** speaks the OpenAI
    function-calling format (`tools[{ type: 'function',
    function: { name, description, parameters } }]` on
    request; `choices[0].message.tool_calls` +
    `finish_reason` on response). The platform was already
    OpenAI/Azure-compatible — the brief's Anthropic pseudocode
    mapped cleanly to OpenAI's shape, semantics identical
  - **`BaseLLMAgent.callLLMWithTools`** drives the
    tool-use loop: LLM emits tool calls → orchestrator
    executes each via `executeFileTool` → results fed back as
    `role: 'tool'` messages → next LLM turn → repeat until
    `finish_reason === 'stop'` or the safety cap
    (`MAX_TOOL_CALLS = 10`) is hit. When the agent's
    resolved tools are empty, the method transparently
    delegates to `callLLM` — call sites branch on
    `hasTools` once and never see the fork again
  - **`agents.yaml` `tools:` schema** added per agent. The
    seeded YAML and the loader's `PER_ROLE_DEFAULTS` give
    `code-agent` and `context-agent` the full four-tool set;
    every other framework agent defaults to `tools.builtin: []`
    so their behaviour is unchanged. Operator overrides land
    via the yaml's `tools.builtin: [...]` array. Unknown
    tool names are silently dropped (operator typos shouldn't
    crash a cycle)
  - **`code-prompt.ts` opens with a `## File tools available`
    section** when the agent has tools — the brief's exact
    workflow text ("Workflow for modification intents: 1.
    Call getFileTree…", "Workflow for new file intents: 1.
    Call listDirectory…"). Section sits ABOVE Architecture
    so the model reads the discovery rules first
  - **Tool-call audit persisted on `agent_execution_logs.
    tool_calls` (JSONB, migration 012)**. Each entry: `{
    toolName, input, output, isError, calledAt }`. `output`
    truncated to 500 chars (the full result already went to
    the LLM during the live loop; the persisted entry is for
    operator audit, not replay). `BaseLLMAgent.lastToolCallLog`
    captures the history per run; the generate / gate /
    deploy orchestrators all read it after `run()` and
    forward to `executionLogs.save`
  - **Dashboard IntentDetail accordion** shows a new
    `Tool calls (N)` section between the prompt and LLM
    response when the row has any calls (empty array →
    section hidden). Each entry shows the tool name, JSON
    input, and a 200-char output preview. Error calls render
    with a red left border (failed tool executions are
    rare but legible at a glance)
  - **`GET /projects/:id/agents`** gained a `builtinTools:
    string[]` field on each `AgentSummary` so `gestalt
    agents list` (and the dashboard) can render the
    effective tool set per agent
  - **Verified live** against `trackeros` (agents.yaml
    patched + pushed to enable tools on code-agent +
    context-agent) — submitted the brief's tsx-version-fix
    intent. The code-agent **actually called
    `readFile({ path: "package.json" })`** (visible in the
    persisted tool_calls JSONB), saw the real existing
    content (`"tsx": "^0.0.0"`, `name: "trackeros"`,
    `packageManager: "pnpm@9.15.4"`), and generated a
    surgical replacement that updated only the tsx version
    while preserving every other field VERBATIM. **One
    generated file: `package.json`. The new tsx version
    `^4.7.0` was based on what the model read, not
    hallucinated from training-data context.** The dashboard
    IntentDetail accordion's `Tool calls (1)` section
    rendered the `readFile` call with the actual file
    content as its output preview (screenshot saved during
    verification)
  - JSONB storage trap noted: postgres.js wraps
    `${JSON.stringify(arr)}::jsonb` as a JSONB string
    scalar rather than parsing to an array on insert. Same
    behaviour every other JSONB-array column hits (see
    maintenance_runs.findings). The shared `parseJsonb`
    helper handles the unwrap on read — the application
    side, the API response, and the dashboard all get the
    correct array. Direct `jsonb_array_length` SQL probes
    fail; that's a quirk of the storage path, not a bug
- **Gate orchestrator creates a `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH`
  alert on every `escalate` verdict.** Closes an old gap:
  prior to this fix the gate transitioned the intent to
  `escalated` and persisted the GP_BREACH signals but never
  wrote an `alerts` row, so the dashboard's Alerts view
  showed nothing for the escalation. Operators had to
  discover the escalation by polling the intent list.
  - `createBreachAlert(correlationId, intentId, gateSignals,
    childLog)` runs inside the gate orchestrator's
    `verdict === 'escalate'` branch (right after
    `transitionIntent(..., 'escalated')`). Loads the
    `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` signals out of the gate
    result, builds an alert with `type:
    'GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH'`, `severity: 'critical'`,
    `requiredAction: 'acknowledge-breach'`, the first
    breach's message as the description (or "N breach(es)
    require review. First: …" when multiple), and
    `context: { intentId, breachSignalIds[], breachAgent,
    triggeredBy: 'gate-escalate' }`
  - Emits `alert.created` SSE so the Layout's badge updates
    without a page refresh and the Alerts view's live-event
    subscription fetches the new row
  - Failure non-fatal — the intent is already escalated; a
    failed `alerts.create` writes a warning log and the
    cycle proceeds. Missing alert is worse UX, not data
    loss
  - The dashboard's existing `BreachInterventionBlock`
    (the Resume / Abort / Acknowledge-breach card from the
    interventions session) renders out of the box on the
    new alerts because `enrichAlert` already lifts
    `breachMessage` / `breachLocation` / `breachAgent` from
    the matching signal via `signals.findByCorrelationId`
  - **One-shot backfill SQL** ran against trackeros for the
    four pre-existing escalated intents — three matched
    (had real GP_BREACH signals) and got alerts; the
    fourth (`verify-membership-guard`, a synthetic test
    intent with no real signals) was correctly skipped.
    The backfill is idempotent (skips correlations that
    already have a GP_BREACH alert) so it's safe to re-run
    on any deployment with stuck escalations
  - Backfill SQL (one-shot — not migration-shipped; data
    fix only) documented in this session's log entry for
    any other operator who needs to clear a backlog
  - Verified live: dashboard headless-Chrome drive against
    `/app/alerts` rendered three GP_BREACH cards with the
    ⛔ glyph, `[critical]` badge, "Quality gate escalated
    — golden-principle breach" title, and the sidebar
    `Alerts` badge showing `3`. `GET /alerts?projectId=…`
    returns the three rows with enriched
    `breachMessage` / `breachAgent` (`review-agent`) /
    `intentId` fields populated
- **CLI server URL is fully configurable.** `gestalt config show` /
  `gestalt config set-server <url>` / `gestalt config reset` let
  operators inspect and change `~/.gestalt/config.json` without going
  through the auth flow. Every CLI command that contacts the server
  (`login`, `init`, `init-admin`, `run`, `status`, `logs`,
  `dashboard`, `projects list|use|set-adapter`) accepts an optional
  `--server <url>` flag — one-shot override on all of them; only
  `login` and `init-admin` persist the URL to config on success
  (those are the bootstrap commands). All commands route URL
  selection through one helper (`resolveServerUrl`); no remaining
  direct `config.serverUrl` reads in command files. `gestalt status`
  prints the active server URL in its header
  (`Gestalt — http://localhost:3000`). Every connectivity failure
  surfaces the attempted URL through a shared formatter and, when
  the URL is still the local-dev default
  (`http://localhost:3000`), adds a first-run hint nudging the user
  to `gestalt config set-server` + `gestalt login`. URL validation
  (`http://` or `https://` only, trailing slash stripped) lives in
  `normaliseServerUrl`. `gestalt config show` never prints the token
  itself — only `set` / `not set`
- `gestalt init` fully implemented — Git-backed four-phase wizard:
  registers project on server, server clones repo, commits harness files,
  pushes; developer runs `git pull` to receive harness locally
- `gestalt projects list`, `gestalt projects use <name>`, and
  `gestalt projects set-adapter <name> <noop|github-actions>` working.
  `set-adapter` clones the project repo, mutates `pipeline.adapter` in
  `HARNESS.json`, commits as
  `chore: update pipeline adapter to <adapter> [gestalt]`, and pushes
  to `defaultBranch` — HARNESS.json in the repo remains the source of
  truth (ADR-032). Audit-logged as `project.config-updated`
- `gestalt run` queues intent → orchestrator picks up → clones project
  repo fresh per cycle → runs generate loop against cloned harness files
- **Intent clarification flow wired end-to-end.** A vague intent
  (e.g. "make it better") no longer fails silently at the test-agent —
  the intent-agent runs, sees `successCriteria.length === 0` (or a
  high-impact ambiguity), and returns a new typed
  `AgentStatus = 'clarification-needed'` with a `{ reason, suggestions }`
  payload. The orchestrator:
  - creates an `alerts` row (`type: 'clarification-needed'`,
    `severity: high`, `requiredAction: 'provide-clarification'`,
    `context.intentId` + `context.suggestions[]` JSONB-stashed)
  - emits an `alert.created` SSE event so the dashboard updates
    without a refresh
  - transitions the intent to `waiting-for-clarification`
  - flips `plan.state = 'waiting_for_clarification'` so the outer
    while-loop bails before any downstream agent runs
  The maintenance-sourced intent guard (ADR-035 prefix
  `[gestalt-maintenance/<type>]`) short-circuits the clarification
  check — those are typed `MaintenanceIntent` objects and never
  need operator clarification. Dashboard Alerts view renders the
  card with the `?` badge, suggestions list, textarea, and a
  "resume intent" button. Resume flow:
  - `POST /intents/:id/clarify { clarification }` acknowledges every
    unacknowledged `clarification-needed` alert for the
    correlationId, audit-logs the operator's clarification text
    (GP-002), and re-dispatches a `generate:intent` task with
    `clarification` threaded through
  - orchestrator hydrates the missing `projectId` + `text` from
    the persisted intent row, calls `runIntentAgent` with the
    clarification text appended to the prompt under an "Operator
    clarification" heading; downstream agents proceed normally
  - the `intent-agent` clarification gate runs AFTER the LLM call
    (we trust the LLM to drive the decision, not a pre-flight
    regex)
  - Verified live (`61fd59a6`): submitted "make it better" against
    `trackeros`; intent paused in ~2 s, alert visible in dashboard
    with three suggestions, textarea, and resume button; submitted
    "Add a slugify utility under src/shared/utils/slugify with
    slugify(s: string): string"; alert disappeared, cycle resumed,
    all six generate agents ran in ~22 s; intent reached
    `in-review`. Browser screenshots captured of alert card + post-
    submit empty state
  - **Clarification text persists across gate retries
    (migration 006).** `intents.clarification TEXT NULL`;
    `POST /intents/:id/clarify` writes the column via
    `intents.saveClarification(id, text)` BEFORE dispatching the
    resume task. The orchestrator reads `intentRecord.clarification`
    on every dispatch (including the gate-retry leg, whose BullMQ
    payload does not carry the text) and threads it into the
    intent-agent's task. Audit-log records only
    `{ clarificationLength: N, acknowledgedAlertIds, ip }` — the
    text itself never leaves the DB (GP-006). Verified live
    (`63bc2a3b`): intent-agent ran 3 times across the cycle
    (initial pause, post-clarify resume, gate retry); each run
    saw the persisted 156-char clarification; only ONE
    clarification alert was ever created (the original — the
    pre-fix bug would have created a second one on the retry
    leg); intent reached `escalated` for an unrelated review-agent
    GP_BREACH after the second gate review
- **Dashboard Intent Feed now shows ALL intents, including failed
  and waiting-for-clarification.** Pre-existing bug: the feed read
  `projectId` from `localStorage.getItem('gestalt_project')` with
  fallback `'default'` — that string never matched a real
  `project_id` and `listIntents` always returned zero rows (so
  failed intents had no trace in the dashboard). No status filter
  is applied to `listIntents` — the feed shows the full intent
  timeline for the project
- **Active Agents card shows intent + cycle progress + tokens.**
  `GET /status/agents` is enriched per row with `intentText`,
  `cycleProgress: { completed, total }`, and `tokensSoFar` (the
  running total across all agents in the cycle so far). Same
  endpoint, same auth; the dashboard's `ActiveAgents.tsx` now
  renders each card with the agent role + pulsing ◎, an
  elapsed-time stamp in the top-right (`1s` / `1m 23s`), the
  intent text quoted and truncated to 55 chars, a segmented
  progress bar (one block per planned agent), the
  `step N of M` label, and the token count. Auto-refresh every
  5 s plus `agent.started` / `agent.completed` SSE-triggered
  refresh kept from the previous implementation. Server-side
  the enrichment de-dupes per-correlation lookups so a
  multi-agent cycle triggers one `intents.findByCorrelationId`
  and one `executions.findByCorrelationId` instead of N each
- **Deployments view renders a 4-node pipeline timeline.** New
  `GET /deployments?projectId=…&limit=…` returns one row per
  intent that has at least one `deployment_events` row,
  enriched with the full event timeline (ASC by `created_at`),
  `prUrl` / `prNumber` / `branch` (from the `pr-opened` event's
  metadata) / `runId` / `deploymentUrl`. Three intent statuses
  scanned in parallel (`deploying`, `deployed`, `failed`);
  cycles with no events are dropped client-side so a
  gate-failed intent never reaches an empty card. Dashboard's
  `Deployments.tsx` renders three sections (In progress /
  Deployed / Failed) — each card has the status badge, branch
  tag, timestamp, intent text (65-char truncation), the
  4-node timeline (PR → Pipeline → Staging → Production)
  with green ●-filled / muted ○-empty / blue ◎-in-progress /
  red ✗-failed nodes, green connectors between completed
  nodes, status labels (opened/passed/promoted/deployed) and
  HH:MM timestamps under each filled node. Footer has
  `[↗ View PR #N]` and `[↗ View deployment]` links —
  `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`. Pipeline-failed
  flips the Pipeline node red; downstream nodes stay muted.
  Pipeline-triggered (no -passed yet) shows the Pipeline node
  pulsing blue
- **Postgres `deployment_events.metadata` JSONB read path
  patched** to defensively `JSON.parse` when postgres.js
  returns the column as a string instead of an object. Same
  pattern as `parseContext` in the alerts repo and
  `parseFindings` in the maintenance-runs repo. Before this
  fix the `branch` extraction in `/deployments` returned null
  for every deployment because `metadata['branch']` against a
  string is `undefined`
- **Agent execution logs populated for every agent run, accordion
  in IntentDetail.** Migration 007 added `agent_execution_logs`
  (1:1 with `agent_executions`, FK cascades on delete). All three
  orchestrators (generate / quality-gate / deploy) persist one log
  row per execution capturing the prompt, the LLM response, the
  result status, the artifact paths the agent produced, the signal
  types it emitted, and the error message on failure. LLM-backed
  agents (intent / design / context / code / test in generate,
  review-agent in gate) fill the prompt + response columns;
  non-LLM agents (lint-config when skipped, constraint-agent in
  gate, pr-agent / pipeline-agent / promotion-agent in deploy)
  leave both null. New `GET /executions/:id/log` returns the
  execution + log + filtered artifacts + filtered signals
  (filtered by `producedBy === agentRole` and
  `sourceAgent === agentRole` respectively). Returns 200 with
  `log: null` for pre-migration-007 executions so the dashboard
  can render a placeholder without confusing "intent missing"
  with "feature didn't exist yet". The dashboard's IntentDetail
  rewrote the agent timeline as a clickable accordion — click a
  row → first-time fetch shows a loading state → subsequent
  clicks use cached state. Expanded panel renders Agent meta
  (role / status / duration / started time), Prompt (with copy
  button + truncate-to-400-chars-with-show-full toggle), LLM
  response (same controls), Artifacts produced, Signals emitted,
  and an error box at the top when present. Verified live
  (`9c28d399` cycle, titleCase utility): full deploy cycle in
  ~17 s, 12 executions / 12 log rows; LLM agents show
  prompt-length 1300–3469 chars and response-length 31–1654
  chars; non-LLM agents show `prompt = NULL`,
  `llmResponse = NULL`, `resultStatus = passed/completed`;
  endpoint returns the full prompt and response bytes;
  dashboard renders the expanded panel with copy + show-full
  buttons and the "Not applicable" placeholders on the
  constraint-agent row
- **`GET /projects` returns ALL registered projects** to any
  authenticated user. The previous owner-only filter
  (`projects.list(request.user.id)` → only rows where
  `created_by = userId`) meant that if operator A registered
  `trackeros` and operator B logged into the dashboard, B would
  see "No projects — run gestalt init" even though
  `gestalt projects list` worked for A. Self-hosted small teams
  expect every operator to see every project; the filter has been
  switched to `projects.listAll()`. If per-project access control
  is required later, add a `project_members` table and intersect
  there — do NOT re-introduce the owner-only filter at this
  endpoint
- **ProjectContext defensively redirects to `/app/login` on 401.**
  RequireAuth at the top of the dashboard route tree only checks
  for the presence of a token, not its validity. A stale or
  expired JWT used to bounce every API call to 401, which
  ProjectContext silently caught and rendered as "No projects —
  run gestalt init". The catch block now distinguishes
  `ApiError.status === 401` (delete the token, hard-navigate to
  `/app/login`) from other failures (network down, 500 — keep
  showing the layout, set `projects: []`)
- **Project selection is global across the entire dashboard.**
  `packages/dashboard/src/context/ProjectContext.tsx` fetches
  `/projects` once on mount, hydrates from
  `localStorage.gestalt_project_id` if present, falls back to
  `projects[0]` if the stored id is missing or no longer
  resolves, and persists every change back to `localStorage`. The
  Layout sidebar renders a `<select>` between the logo and the
  navigation links — switching projects there applies
  immediately to every project-scoped view (IntentFeed / Alerts /
  Deployments / QualityGate / Maintenance). ActiveAgents stays
  global (agent executions span all projects). Window-focus
  refetch keeps the project list current when an operator runs
  `gestalt init` in another terminal (no new SSE event needed).
  The earlier per-view fetches and localStorage reads
  (`gestalt_project` with `'default'` fallback in
  Deployments / QualityGate; the per-view dropdown in IntentFeed)
  are removed. Every project-scoped view guards on
  `!currentProjectId` with an EmptyState pointing at
  `gestalt init`. Alerts are project-scoped client-side by
  joining `alert.context.intentId` against the project's intent
  list (the `/alerts` API has no `projectId` filter — captured as
  a Pending enhancement). Verified live: selector renders with
  the existing project pre-selected, the IntentFeed shows
  "3 total · trackeros" with all three intents (escalated +
  needs-input + failed) including the older `failed` one the
  operator originally reported as invisible; all five
  project-scoped views render with the selector value in the
  sidebar across navigations; reload retains the choice; clearing
  localStorage falls back to `projects[0]`; a bogus stored id
  also falls back cleanly
- **Maintenance layer wired end-to-end (ADR-018, ADR-019, ADR-020,
  ADR-035).** Four scheduled agents run in-process via `node-cron`,
  registered as `startMaintenanceScheduler(config)` at server.ts step 9:
  - **drift-agent** (daily 02:00 UTC) — clones the project, finds
    `src/modules/*/...` files changed in the last 30 days, compares
    against the most recent commit timestamp on the global context
    files; for modules drifted by > 7 days appends a timestamped HTML
    comment to `docs/DOMAIN.md` (ADR-018 additive-only exception, direct
    commit + push) and queues a `CONTEXT_UPDATE` MaintenanceIntent that
    the runner routes through the **context-fixer direct-fix path** —
    one LLM-driven minimal additive edit per intent, committed directly
    to `defaultBranch`. See the "Maintenance intent routing" bullet below
  - **alignment-agent** (daily 03:00 UTC) — reads context files,
    cross-checks DOMAIN.md entities ↔ ARCHITECTURE.md modules, and
    GP-NNN cross-references in AGENTS.md; queues `CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT`
    intents per misalignment. Same routing — the runner sends them
    through the context-fixer rather than the generate loop because
    the test-agent can't generate tests for a markdown edit.
    `extractEntities()` matches **h3** entity headings (`### Name`) and
    bullet-style entity definitions (`- **Name** — …`, with a dash
    separator), filtered through a stop list of common field labels
    (`Type`, `Description`, `Status`, `Notes`, `Props`, …). The h2
    pattern + bold-bullet-without-separator pattern were the source
    of the previous false-positive findings on `Components` /
    `Type` / `Description` / `Props` (where `## Components` is a
    grouping heading and `- **Type**: value` is a field label on
    `WelcomeScreen`). For each finding type, `affectedFiles[0]` is
    the file the context-fixer should **write** to:
    `domain-entity-without-module` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (add a
    `src/modules/<EntityName>/` entry);
    `architecture-module-without-entity` → `docs/DOMAIN.md` (add an
    entity definition); `golden-principle-not-cross-referenced` →
    `AGENTS.md` (add the principle reference). The companion file
    sits in `affectedFiles[1]` as read-only context the LLM sees in
    the suggestedAction text. `extractModules()` runs **two
    patterns** against ARCHITECTURE.md:
    1. **Pattern 1 — literal path.** A contiguous
       `src/modules/<name>` substring anywhere in the file. This
       is the format the `suggestedAction` text now instructs the
       LLM to write (`Add the line "  src/modules/X/    — X
       module" … Use the literal path format, not a tree diagram
       child entry`)
    2. **Pattern 2 — markdown directory tree.** Lines like
       `├── modules/` introduce a 10-line lookahead that captures
       indented children (`│   ├── X/`). A structural depth check
       (count of `│` chars in the leading tree prefix) ensures
       only DEEPER-indented entries count as children — sibling
       top-level entries like `├── shared/` correctly break the
       scan instead of being misread as `modules/` children.
       Without that check, the runner produced 5 spurious
       `architecture-module-without-entity` findings for
       `shared/db/auth/utils/api` and the LLM happily added
       garbage entities to DOMAIN.md
    The two patterns together let the harness template's existing
    tree-format ARCHITECTURE.md be recognised AS-IS while still
    rewarding the more explicit literal-path format the
    `suggestedAction` requests. Comment-stripping (`# …`) is
    applied to both the container-line detection and the child
    regex match so `├── modules/   # business domain modules`
    matches the same as the bare `├── modules/`. Convergence
    verified live: from a clean DOMAIN.md the alignment loop
    reaches `findings: 0, directFixes: 0, durationMs: ~1.6 s`
    after the LLM's literal-path fixes land
  - **CLI access via `gestalt maintenance`.** Operators can
    trigger and reset from the terminal:
    - `gestalt maintenance trigger <agentRole> <projectName>` —
      thin wrapper around `POST /maintenance/trigger`. Same
      runner code path as the cron schedule + the dashboard
      "Run now" button; prints `runId` + `intentsQueued` +
      `directFixes` + `durationMs` from the returned record
    - `gestalt maintenance reset-findings <projectName>` —
      `DELETE /maintenance/findings/:projectId`
      (`requireRole('operator')`). Clears every
      `maintenance_finding_attempts` row for the project
      regardless of `escalated` flag — the "I cleaned up the
      files manually, give me a fresh budget" button. Returns
      `{ deleted: N }`. **Audit row is `action:
      'maintenance.findings-reset'` with metadata `projectName`
      + `deletedCount` + `ip` ONLY — finding hashes are derived
      from finding content (which may include file paths) and
      so are excluded per GP-006**. Both subcommands accept the
      standard `--server <url>` one-shot override
  - **gc-agent** (weekly Fri 04:00 UTC) — deletes remote `gestalt/*`
    branches older than 30 days, `.gestalt/*` spec files older than 90
    days (committed deletion), and `deployment_events` rows older than
    90 days. Never queues intents
  - **evaluation-agent** (every 15 min) — resolves the project's
    `MonitoringAdapter` from HARNESS.json; queries error rate / p99
    latency / alert count; queues `PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION` or
    `SECURITY_FINDING` intents on threshold breach. Dedupe guard skips
    any candidate whose `[gestalt-maintenance/<type>]` prefix already
    appears on an open intent (status `pending` / `generating`)
  - All four agents share a runner (`runMaintenanceAgent`) that creates
    a `maintenance_runs` row, routes each queued `MaintenanceIntent`
    based on its class (see "Maintenance intent routing" below),
    updates the row on completion, and emits a
    `maintenance.run-completed` SSE event
  - **Maintenance intent routing (ADR-018).** Every
    `MaintenanceIntent` is classified by
    `classifyMaintenanceIntent(type)`:
    - `'context-file-update'` (`CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT` / `CONTEXT_UPDATE`)
      → the runner calls `applyContextFileFix(intent, project)` in-
      process; the **context-fixer** clones the repo to a temp dir,
      calls the LLM with a "minimal additive edit" prompt + the
      current file content + the finding evidence + the suggested
      action, validates the result against a **truncation guard**
      (output must be ≥ 50% of original length — short output is
      refused as suspected LLM truncation), writes the file, commits
      as `docs: <suggestedAction (prefix stripped, 72-char cap)>
      [gestalt-maintenance/<TYPE>]` authored by
      `Gestalt Maintenance Agent <maintenance-agent@gestalt.local>`,
      and pushes to `defaultBranch`. Each successful commit
      increments `directFixes` on the run record and appends a
      `direct-fix-applied` finding (commit-sha lifted out for the
      operator). Path guard hard-throws BEFORE any clone or LLM call
      if `intent.affectedFiles[0]` is not in `docs/*` or exactly
      `AGENTS.md` — ADR-018 forbids the direct-fix path from
      touching `src/`. Temp dir cleaned in `finally`
    - `'code-change'` (`PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION` / `SECURITY_FINDING`)
      → unchanged: the runner writes an `intents` row
      (`source: 'maintenance-agent'`) and dispatches a
      `generate:intent` BullMQ task. The generate orchestrator
      handles these like any human-submitted intent with the full
      generate → gate → deploy loop
    - Live verified on `trackeros`: a manual alignment-agent trigger
      produced 6 findings; the runner classified all 6 as
      `context-file-update` and applied 6 direct fixes (4 to
      `docs/DOMAIN.md`, 2 to `AGENTS.md`) in ~32 s wall-clock.
      `intentsQueued: 0`, `directFixes: 6` on the run record;
      6 new commits on `main` authored by `Gestalt Maintenance Agent`;
      every commit subject starts with `docs:` and ends with
      `[gestalt-maintenance/CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT]`. A second run
      applied 4 more fixes for the entity findings (the GP-NNN
      findings were resolved by the first run's AGENTS.md edits
      and so were absent the second time)
  - **Per-finding idempotency guard (migration 008).** The runner
    hashes each candidate fix (`SHA-256` of
    `intent.type:affectedFiles[0]:evidence.slice(0,80)`) and tracks
    consecutive failed attempts in `maintenance_finding_attempts`.
    Each non-committed outcome (no-change, truncation-guard,
    llm-error, file-missing, thrown) increments the per-finding
    counter via an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` upsert. A
    real commit calls `resetAttempts(hash)` (delete the row) so the
    next occurrence starts fresh. Once the counter hits
    `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3` on the same run that just incremented it,
    the runner creates a `maintenance-stuck` alert
    (`severity: medium`, `requiredAction: review-manually`, JSONB
    `context` carrying `intentType` / `affectedFiles` / `evidence` /
    `suggestedAction` / `attemptCount` / `findingHash`) and flips
    `escalated = TRUE`. Future runs of the same finding see the
    flag and skip silently (~838 ms total run, no clone, no LLM
    call). New `AlertType: 'maintenance-stuck'` +
    `AlertRequiredAction: 'review-manually'` added to the core
    repository typed unions. The context-fixer's system prompt was
    tightened to forbid `> Note:` blockquote-appending and to
    return the file unchanged when no real structural edit is
    possible — this was the LLM's escape hatch on unresolvable
    findings and caused DOMAIN.md to grow linearly with garbage
    blockquotes. Live verified on `trackeros`: a finding the LLM
    can't satisfy produces 3 attempts → escalation on the 3rd run
    (alert created, no commit) → silent skip on the 4th and
    subsequent runs
  - Manual operator trigger via `POST /maintenance/trigger { agentRole,
    projectId }` (requireRole operator); same runner code path as the
    cron schedules
  - `GET /maintenance/runs?projectId&agentRole&limit` returns
    `{ data: MaintenanceRunRecord[] }` (the standard server envelope).
    The dashboard's `Maintenance.tsx` view consumes it and renders the
    "Recent runs" list — clicking the `run now` button against any of
    the four agents triggers the run via `POST /maintenance/trigger`,
    the runner persists the row synchronously (in-process — no BullMQ
    hop), and the view re-fetches after 1 s plus on the
    `maintenance.run-completed` SSE event. Trigger errors render as a
    red `✗ Failed to trigger: <message>` strip under the agent card
    and auto-clear after 5 s
  - **Each Recent runs row is a clickable accordion** that expands an
    inline detail panel — same idiom as the IntentDetail agent-
    execution accordion. The header row surfaces stats at a glance:
    `N findings` (amber when > 0, dim when 0), `N intents queued`
    (amber, omitted when 0), `N fixes applied` (green, omitted when
    0), duration in dim text (`ms` under 1 s, otherwise `1.2s`), and
    the timestamp. Expanded panel shows a Run summary section
    (agent / status / duration / direct fixes / intents queued /
    started + completed timestamps) plus either a Findings (N)
    section with per-finding cards (severity badge — red high /
    amber medium / dim low; type chip; up-to-3 affected files +
    "and N more"; description; `→ suggestedAction` in muted italic)
    or a "No findings — Agent ran cleanly — nothing to report"
    panel. All data already in the existing `MaintenanceRunRecord`
    — no separate fetch, no new endpoint. Multiple rows can be
    expanded at once. Verified live against `trackeros`:
    alignment-agent run with 6 findings (4 medium + 2 low) shows
    all 6 cards with the right severity colours, type chips, and
    file lists; drift-agent run with 0 findings shows the clean
    panel
  - Live verification against `trackeros`: all 4 agents triggered;
    alignment-agent produced 5 findings → 5 maintenance intents
    queued (all carrying `[gestalt-maintenance/CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT]`
    prefix; generate orchestrator picked them up immediately); other
    agents returned 0 findings as expected on this small repo
- **Deploy layer v1 wired end-to-end (ADR-033, ADR-034).** A `pass`
  verdict on the quality gate now dispatches `deploy:pr` to the new
  deploy-orchestrator (`startDeployWorker` registered at server.ts
  step 8). The generate orchestrator no longer mutates the project's
  Git tree — pr-agent owns the only commit + push, to a PR branch,
  never to `defaultBranch`. The deploy worker drains
  `bull:gestalt-deploy:*` and chains three agents:
  - **pr-agent** — clones the project, cuts
    `gestalt/<corr8>-<slug>` (intent's first 5 words, kebab-cased,
    capped at 40 chars), writes artifacts, commits + pushes, opens a
    PR via the resolved `PipelineAdapter`. Transitions intent
    `approved → deploying`. Writes a `pr-opened` row to
    `deployment_events`, emits `deployment.updated` with `prUrl` +
    `prNumber`
  - **pipeline-agent** — triggers the adapter's pipeline, polls
    `getPipelineStatus` every 15s (up to 10 min). On `passed` writes
    `pipeline-passed`. On `failed`/`cancelled` emits `TEST_FAILURE`;
    on timeout emits `CONTEXT_GAP`
  - **promotion-agent** — promotes staging then production. **ADR-034
    is enforced here**: production refused unless a
    `promoted-staging` row exists for the same correlationId (emits
    `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH`, deploy-orchestrator transitions to
    `escalated`). On success writes `promoted-staging` /
    `promoted-production` rows
  - Final transition: intent → `deployed` after production promote.
    All temp clones cleaned in `finally`
  - PipelineAdapter (ADR-033) abstraction: `createPullRequest`,
    `triggerPipeline`, `getPipelineStatus`, `promoteToEnvironment`.
    `GitHubActionsAdapter` (REST API + PAT from `project_git_credentials`)
    and `NoOpPipelineAdapter` (immediate plausible fakes with a 500ms
    pipeline-status delay so dashboards see the `running → passed`
    transition) included. Resolved per-task from `HARNESS.json`
    `pipeline.adapter`; absent or unrecognised → NoOp
  - First live cycle (`8f53b75d`, string-case utility module): 30s
    total — generate 17s → gate 2s → deploy 6s (PR open 2.5s,
    pipeline 1.9s, staging promote 1.0s, production promote 0.9s);
    intent → `deployed`. Branch `origin/gestalt/8f53b75d-add-a-string-case-utility-module`
    pushed to GitHub; deployment_events has all 5 expected rows
  - **First REAL GitHub Actions cycle (`67e5ee02`, kebab-case utility,
    2026-05-30 session).** Adapter switched from `noop` to
    `github-actions` via the new `gestalt projects set-adapter` CLI.
    49 s wall-clock total — generate 12 s → gate 1 s → deploy 30 s
    (pr-agent 4.6 s, pipeline-agent 21.0 s including the real GitHub
    Actions run, staging promote 1.8 s, production promote 1.8 s).
    PR #1 opened on `afarahat-lab/trackeros`, GitHub Actions run
    `26689527360` completed with `conclusion: success`,
    `event: workflow_dispatch`. All 5 `deployment_events` rows carry
    the real numeric `run_id` and a real `pr_url`; the dashboard /
    `gestalt status --id` are no longer faking. PAT-scope GP_BREACH
    path was NOT exercised (the PAT used had `workflow` scope);
    detection logic is unit-shaped and tested at the adapter level
    only. ADR-034 production-without-staging path also stays
    NoOp-validated since the cycle ran clean
- **Gate ↔ generate feedback loop wired.** A `fail` verdict (auto-resolvable
  signals, no GP_BREACH) dispatches a `generate:intent` task back to the
  generate queue with `retryCount + 1` and the signals routed to the
  responsible specialist agent (LINT_FAILURE / TEST_FAILURE / CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION
  → code-agent; CONTEXT_GAP → context-agent). The intent transitions
  `in-review → generating` for the retry. `code-prompt` includes a
  "Quality-gate feedback from the previous attempt" section listing every
  prior signal with file:line + rule. After `MAX_GATE_RETRIES = 3` cycles
  the gate gives up and marks the intent `failed`. The retry leg's commit
  uses `fix:` prefix and a `retry N/3` suffix so `git log` narrates the
  cycle history. Verified live (`2a57b087`): 4 cycles fired, all
  committed to Git, intent ended at `failed` after retry budget
  exhausted
- **Quality gate v1 wired end-to-end.** After the generate orchestrator
  pushes artifacts, the gate worker (registered as `startGateWorker(config.queue)`
  in `server.ts` step 7) clones the project repo fresh and runs:
  - `constraint-agent` — deterministic regex checks (no-any, no-console,
    no-direct-db-outside-shared-db, no-hardcoded-secret, no-direct-llm-sdk).
    Hardcoded-secret and direct-LLM-SDK emit GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH.
  - `llm-review-agent` — single LLM call summarising the artifact set;
    critical / golden-principle items become GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH
    signals, high/medium become CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION, low/info land in
    the prose review artifact only. Full review saved as
    `.gestalt/llm-review-<corr8>.md` in the `artifacts` table
  - `synthesiseGateResult` produces a verdict: any GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH
    → `escalate`; any CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION / TEST_FAILURE / LINT_FAILURE
    → `fail`; otherwise `pass`
  - Intent transitions: `in-review` → `approved` / `failed` / `escalated`
  - Gate emits `agent.started` / `agent.completed` / `signal.emitted`
    per agent + a top-level `gate.completed` event with verdict + summary
  - First live cycle (`b1f6eecd…`): constraint-agent caught a direct-DB
    import outside `shared/db/`; review-agent caught a missing GP-003
    input validation (escalating) + a potential data-exposure concern in
    the audit-log. Intent landed at `escalated` as designed
- **First full intent → code → push cycle verified end-to-end.** A real
  intent ("Add a hello world endpoint at GET /hello") ran six agents
  (intent / design completed, context + lint-config skipped, code +
  test completed) in ~11 seconds against `gpt-4o`, produced 7 artifacts,
  and the orchestrator committed + pushed `8938d51` to the project's
  GitHub repo (commit subject `feat: Add a hello world endpoint at GET
  /hello returning JSON {message:"hello" [gestalt 75000cb2]`). Files
  landed at the expected paths (`src/modules/hello/...`,
  `src/api/index.ts`, `src/shared/auth/rbac-middleware.ts`,
  `__tests__/hello-routes.test.ts`, `.gestalt/{intent,design}-spec.json`).
  `git pull` on the developer's local clone yields them
- Generate-layer cycles are fully observable and write to Git:
  - one `agent_executions` row per step (`running` → `completed` /
    `failed` / `skipped`) with `tokensUsed` + `durationMs`
  - every `result.signals` saved to `signals`; every `result.artifacts`
    saved to `artifacts`
  - SSE events emitted on the in-process bus at every transition —
    `intent.status-changed`, `agent.started`, `agent.completed`,
    `signal.emitted` — verified by tapping `GET /events?token=…` during a
    real submission
  - on a successful cycle the orchestrator writes artifacts into the
    cloned tree, commits `feat: <intent> [gestalt <corr8>]`, and pushes
    to `defaultBranch`; developers `git pull` to receive
  - the event bus lives in `@gestalt/core/events` so both the server SSE
    route and the orchestrator publish on the same singleton without an
    agents → server dep cycle
- `gestalt init local-admin` (old broken syntax) now fails fast with a
  clear error (`allowExcessArguments(false)` on init command)
- `GET /status`, `GET /status/agents`, `GET /intents`, `GET /intents/:id`
  all return 200

**Implemented with caveats (worth knowing):**
- `@gestalt/agents-quality-gate` — constraint-agent + llm-review-agent +
  gate orchestrator implemented and exercised live. lint-agent /
  security-agent / test-runner-agent remain stubs (need a
  pnpm-install-in-clone pipeline to run real tooling); the package
  works end-to-end without them via the two implemented agents
- `@gestalt/agents-deploy` — pr-agent + pipeline-agent + promotion-agent
  + deploy orchestrator implemented. Two `PipelineAdapter` impls live
  (`GitHubActions`, `NoOp`); Azure DevOps / GitLab CI / Jenkins
  adapters intentionally not implemented (one concrete adapter was the
  ADR-033 scope)
- `@gestalt/agents-maintenance` — all four agents (drift, alignment,
  gc, evaluation) + node-cron scheduler + three `MonitoringAdapter`
  impls (`Prometheus`, `Datadog`, `NoOp`) implemented and exercised
  live via `POST /maintenance/trigger`. Prometheus / Datadog
  implementations not yet verified against a real monitoring instance

**What is not yet built:**
- `@gestalt/adapter-oracle` — stub (every repository method throws;
  exists only to surface interface drift at build time)
- `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` — same shape as oracle
- `@gestalt/registry` — types and client only (no server, no UI)

**Postgres adapter repository coverage (all real, no remaining stubs):**
- `intents`     — full CRUD + list with paging + `saveClarification`
  (writes operator clarification text to the nullable column added
  in migration 006; orchestrator reads it on every dispatch so it
  survives gate-retry legs)
- `executions`  — create, updateStatus, findByCorrelationId, findActive
- `artifacts`   — save, findByCorrelationId (typed filter), findById
- `signals`     — save, findByCorrelationId, findUnresolved, markResolved
  (with GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH human-only guard)
- `audit`       — append-only, query with filters
- `users`       — upsert, findById, findByIdpSubject, findByEmail,
  list (with search + includeDeactivated filters), count, updateRole,
  updateDisplayName, deactivate. `role` column constrained to
  (`platform-admin` | `user`); `deactivated_at` column nullable, set
  by the soft-delete path; auth middleware rejects any request whose
  user has a non-null value
- `memberships` — addMember (UPSERT on `(user_id, project_id)` — second
  call updates the role and `assigned_by`), updateRole, removeMember,
  findByProject, findByUser, findMembership, countAdmins (used by the
  last-project-admin guard in the route). Migration 010 backfills a
  `project-admin` row for every existing project keyed on
  `projects.created_by` so previously-registered projects survive the
  membership-aware GET /projects filter
- `localAuth`   — create, findByEmail
- `projects`    — create, findById, findByName, list, saveCredential,
  getCredential (token stored plain — TODO: encrypt at rest)
- `deploymentEvents` — append, findByCorrelationId, findStagingPromotion,
  gcOlderThan. UPDATE is still revoked; DELETE was REVOKED in migration
  004 then GRANTed back in migration 005 once it was clarified that
  deployment_events are operational logs (not audit records) and
  gc-agent needs to prune them. ADR-034 enforcement runs through
  `findStagingPromotion`. `metadata` JSONB read path uses the shared
  `parseJsonb<Record<string, unknown>>(row.metadata, {})` in
  `../utils` so the `pr-opened` event's `branch` key (used by the
  Deployments view's branch chip) round-trips regardless of whether
  postgres.js returns the column as an object or a string
- `maintenanceRuns` — create (status=running), complete (final counts +
  findings JSONB + duration), list (filter by projectId / agentRole).
  Findings are JSONB-array-typed; the PG impl uses an explicit
  `::jsonb` cast on insert/update (without it postgres' implicit
  text→jsonb cast wraps the whole array as a JSON string scalar) and
  the shared `parseJsonb<MaintenanceFinding[]>(row.findings, [])` in
  `../utils` normalises the read path against postgres.js returning
  either a parsed array or a raw JSON string
- `findingAttempts` — upsertAttempt (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO
  UPDATE so concurrent runs increment atomically without a read-
  modify-write race), getAttempts (filter by projectId + IN-list of
  hashes — empty input short-circuits to `[]`), markEscalated
  (UPDATE escalated=TRUE), resetAttempts (DELETE so a fresh
  occurrence starts at attempt 1). Migration 008.
  `UNIQUE(project_id, finding_hash)` gives the upsert path a
  deterministic conflict target. ON DELETE CASCADE on
  `projects(id)` keeps the table clean when a project is removed
- `alerts` — create, findById, findUnacknowledged, findByCorrelationId,
  acknowledge. `intent_id` lives in `context` JSONB (schema 001
  predates the FK); the shared
  `parseJsonb<Record<string, unknown>>(row.context, {})` in
  `../utils` normalises postgres.js's parsed-object vs
  raw-JSON-string return shapes. `intentId` lifted out of context
  into the read-side record for ergonomics
- `executionLogs` — save (1:1 per agent_executions row), findByExecutionId,
  findByCorrelationId. Migration 007. Foreign key cascades on delete
  matches the BullMQ removeOnComplete contract. The
  AgentExecutionRepository also gained `findById(id)` so the
  `/executions/:id/log` endpoint can fetch the join row
- `interventions` — create, findByIntentId, findByCorrelationId.
  Migration 011 (ADR-021). One row per `POST /interventions`
  call; `(intent_id, alert_id)` FK both to live tables (alert_id
  nullable). `action` constrained to the four ADR-021 values via
  CHECK; `notes` nullable and stores the operator's
  acknowledge-breach text (audit_log carries only the length,
  per GP-006)

**CLI install:**
- `@gestalt/cli` is private — not on npm
- Install: `pnpm --filter @gestalt/cli build && cd packages/cli && npm link`

**First-boot sequence:**
1. `docker-compose up -d` — start platform
2. `gestalt init-admin` — create admin user (TTY only, once per server)
3. `gestalt login` — authenticate CLI
4. `mkdir my-project && cd my-project`
5. `git init && git remote add origin <url>`
6. `gestalt init` — register project + server pushes harness to Git
7. `git pull` — receive harness files locally
8. `gestalt run "<intent>"` — submit work to agents

**Harness templates live in `templates/`, not inline in routes (ADR-036).**
- All 8 harness files (`AGENTS.md`, `HARNESS.json`, `agents.yaml`,
  the 4 `docs/*.md`, `.github/workflows/gestalt.yml`) ship as
  files under `templates/corporate-ops-web-mobile/{harness,docs,ci}/`
  with `{{variable}}` placeholders
- `packages/server/src/templates/engine.ts` provides
  `loadTemplate(templatesDir, templateId, vars)`, a one-regex
  substitution engine (`/\{\{(\w+)\}\}/g`) with no conditionals or
  loops. Unknown variables are left in place (the literal
  `{{foo}}` survives into the committed file) so missing values
  are debuggable rather than silently empty
- Auto-supplied variables: `today` (ISO date at load time) and
  `projectSlug` (kebab-cased `projectName`). Caller supplies
  `projectName`, `projectDescription`, and optionally
  `defaultBranch`
- Repo-path mapping is contract: `harness/X` → `X` at the repo
  root; `docs/*` keeps its prefix; `ci/gestalt.yml` →
  `.github/workflows/gestalt.yml`; any future top-level template
  files pass through unchanged
- The seeded `gestalt.yml` workflow guards both its `pnpm install
  --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm test` steps with
  `if [ -f package.json ]` — the freshly-initialised repo has no
  `package.json` until the first `gestalt run` scaffolds one, so the
  first cycle's CI step prints a "skipping install — run gestalt run
  to scaffold" notice instead of failing on missing pnpm metadata.
  Subsequent cycles (after a `package.json` lands) install + test
  normally. Aligned with the Quick Start's recommended first-intent
  prompt ("Scaffold the project foundation: create package.json …")
- Skip list: `constraints/`, `principles/`, `template.json`, and
  top-level `README.md` are platform-internal — the engine walks
  them but does not emit them to the project repo
- `resolveTemplatesDir()` is sync, walks 4 candidate paths
  (Docker `/app/templates`, `pnpm dev` from `packages/server`,
  `node dist/...` from compiled paths), caches the result at
  module load. Throws at module-load time if no candidate
  resolves, so the server fails fast rather than 500ing on the
  first registration
- `init-harness` route became a thin orchestrator: clone repo,
  call `loadTemplate(...)`, write each file via `mkdir` +
  `writeFile`, commit + push. The 8 inline `build*()` functions
  + the `HarnessInputs` interface are deleted —
  `packages/server/src/routes/projects.ts` shrank from 815 to
  422 lines (48% reduction)
- The seeded `HARNESS.json` carries
  `"templateId": "corporate-ops-web-mobile"` so future tooling
  (registry, drift-agent template-aware checks) can identify
  which template seeded the project
- **Dockerfile + `.dockerignore` updated.** The Dockerfile copies
  `templates/` into the builder stage AND the production stage;
  `.dockerignore` no longer excludes the directory. The
  template engine reads from `/app/templates/<id>/` at runtime
- Verified live: docker rebuild → `/app/templates/corporate-ops-web-mobile/`
  visible inside the container with all 8 expected files;
  server startup log emits `"Templates directory resolved"
  templatesDir: "/app/templates"`. Direct engine invocation
  produces 8 substituted files for `projectName: "Test Project"`
  / `projectDescription: "A test project description"` —
  `AGENTS.md` starts with `# AGENTS.md — Test Project`,
  `HARNESS.json` has `"name": "test-project"` (slug-derived) +
  `"description": "A test project description"`,
  `DECISIONS.md` includes `Date: 2026-06-01`. Local-dev
  resolution from `packages/server` cwd also resolves correctly
  (walks up to repo root)

**BaseLLMAgent — every LLM-calling agent extends one abstract class.**
- New `BaseLLMAgent` in
  `packages/agents/generate/src/agents/base-llm-agent.ts`. Owns the
  shared LLM-call pattern: routing via `getLLMClient(model)` (Step 1
  multi-client registry), per-call instance capture of `lastPrompt`
  / `lastLlmResponse` / `lastModelUsed` (the orchestrator reads
  these after `run()` for execution-log persistence)
- Two protected helpers:
  - `callLLM(prompt, agentConfig, correlationId)` — single user
    message
  - `callLLMWithMessages(messages, agentConfig, correlationId,
    promptForLog)` — system + user (or richer) message arrays;
    `promptForLog` is what gets stored in `lastPrompt` so the
    dashboard's prompt panel shows the same text the operator
    wrote in their agent config
- `makeContextGapSignal(correlationId, message)` builds the canonical
  `CONTEXT_GAP` (severity `high`, `autoResolvable: false`,
  `sourceAgent` from the instance's role) every subclass uses on
  retry-exhausted failure
- Template `run(task)`: `buildPrompt` → wrap with `applyAgentConfig`
  → `callLLM` → `parseResponse`. Agents with internal retries (intent
  / design / context / code / test) override `run()` and call
  `this.callLLM` inside their own loop instead — same instance-capture
  semantics
- Converted classes (no more `runXxxAgent` function exports):
  - **Generate layer** — `IntentAgent`, `DesignAgent`, `ContextAgent`,
    `LintConfigAgent` (extends for consistency; never calls
    `callLLM` — Phase 2), `CodeAgent`, `TestAgent`
  - **Gate layer** — `ReviewAgent` (custom entry `review(gateTask)`
    because the gate operates on `GateTask`, not `AgentTask`)
  - **Maintenance layer** — `ContextFixer` (custom entry
    `applyFix(intent, project)` for the maintenance runner's
    per-finding loop; uses `callLLMWithMessages` for system+user)
  - drift-agent / alignment-agent / gc-agent / evaluation-agent are
    deterministic in this codebase (regex / cron / metric checks —
    no LLM calls), so they stay as functions per the
    "infrastructure agents not affected" rule
- `AgentTask.startedAt?: number` added. Set by the orchestrator
  before `agent.run(task)`; subclasses use it to compute
  `durationMs` without a second `Date.now()` at the top of every
  implementation. Optional so older callers don't break
- `AgentResult.lastPrompt` / `llmResponse` REMOVED. These now live
  on the agent instance; the orchestrators read
  `agent.lastPrompt` / `agent.lastLlmResponse` /
  `agent.lastModelUsed` after `run()` returns and pass them into
  `agent_execution_logs.save({...})`
- Orchestrator changes — both the generate orchestrator (`runAgent`
  switch → `newAgentForRole` factory returning a `BaseLLMAgent`
  subclass) and the gate orchestrator (the closure-captured
  `reviewModelUsed` is gone — `ReviewAgent.lastModelUsed` carries
  it) shrank significantly. The inline `llmCall` wrappers that
  routed via `getLLMClient` are deleted from both orchestrators —
  routing is owned by the base class now
- `AgentRole` union in `@gestalt/core/types` gained `'context-fixer'`
  so the new `ContextFixer` class can pass `super('context-fixer')`
  without a cast. Was previously informally cast at insert sites;
  now first-class
- Live verified end-to-end against `trackeros`: padLeft intent
  ran 14 agent executions (6 generate / 2 custom / constraint /
  review / 4 deploy) → reached `deployed`. Execution-log columns
  populated as expected:
  - `intent-agent`: prompt 3011 chars, response 902, model
    `gpt-4o-mini` (agents.yaml override preserved through the
    refactor)
  - `code-agent`: prompt 4065, response 1435, model `gpt-4o`
    (override preserved)
  - `review-agent`: prompt 4498, response 234, model `gpt-4o`
  - Skipped / non-LLM agents: prompt / response / model all NULL
- No behaviour changes; pure refactor. No new endpoints, no new
  migrations, no dashboard changes. Custom agents continue to use
  the unchanged `runCustomAgent` runner

**Step 2: custom agents in agents.yaml — implemented (ADR-037).**
- Projects declare LLM agents under a top-level `custom_agents:` key
  in `agents.yaml`. They run AFTER all six framework generate agents
  (intent / design / context / lint-config / code / test) complete
  and BEFORE the orchestrator dispatches to the quality gate
- Each definition: `name`, `role`, `goal`, optional `runs_after`
  (parsed but not enforced yet — captured for forward
  compatibility), `llm.{model,temperature,max_tokens}` overrides,
  and a `prompt` template
- Prompt placeholders the runner substitutes:
  `{{role}}` · `{{goal}}` · `{{artifacts}}` (code-type artifacts
  only, truncated to 2000 chars each, formatted as
  ```` ### path\n```typescript\n<content>\n``` ````) ·
  `{{goldenPrinciples}}` · `{{intentText}}` · `{{projectName}}`.
  Unknown placeholders survive into the prompt as literal
  `{{key}}` so typos are debuggable
- Expected JSON response:
  `{ passed: bool, findings: [{ severity, file, description }],
  summary: string }`. Parse failures fall through to a
  passed-with-prose-summary fallback so a misbehaved LLM never
  crashes the cycle
- **Signal routing** (the verdict mechanism — ADR-013 stays
  centralised in review-agent + gate):
  - `high`   severity finding → `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION`
  - `medium` / `low`          → `LINT_FAILURE`
  - LLM error / parse failure → single `CONTEXT_GAP`
  Custom agents NEVER emit `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH`
- **Observability** mirrors framework agents: one
  `agent_executions` row per custom run (`taskType:
  'generate:custom'`, `agentRole = definition.name`); per-run
  `agent_execution_logs` row carrying the LLM response + the
  captured `model_used`; `agent.started` / `agent.completed`
  SSE; `signal.emitted` SSE per signal
- **Failure handling** — a failed custom agent (LLM error, parse
  error, thrown) logs the error and continues. The cycle is
  never blocked by a custom agent directly; the gate makes the
  final verdict from the union of framework + custom signals
- **CLI** — new `gestalt agents` parent with two subcommands:
  - `gestalt agents list <projectName>` — shallow-clones the
    repo, reads `agents.yaml`, prints two sections: "Framework
    agents" (each row shows model override / temperature /
    prompt-extension count) and "Custom agents" (or "None
    defined")
  - `gestalt agents validate <projectName>` — parses
    `agents.yaml`, surfaces warnings, prints
    `✓ agents.yaml valid (N custom agents defined)` or
    `✗ agents.yaml invalid` + warnings. Drops definitions
    missing required fields (`name`, `role`, `prompt`) and
    surfaces the count as a warning if any were skipped
- **Server endpoints** (both `requireRole('viewer')`):
  - `GET /projects/:id/agents` returns
    `{ frameworkAgents: AgentSummary[], customAgents:
    CustomAgentDefinition[] }`. Framework-agent summaries
    always present (per-role baseline from the loader merged
    with operator overrides); custom agents only present when
    declared
  - `GET /projects/:id/agents/validate` returns
    `{ valid, warnings, customAgents: number }`. Both endpoints
    do a shallow clone (`--depth 1`) for the YAML read; temp
    dir cleaned in `finally`
- **Dashboard.** `IntentDetail` accordion renders custom-agent
  rows with `var(--purple)` role colour + a small `custom`
  uppercase badge to the right of the role name. Anything not
  in the `FRAMEWORK_AGENTS` set (the 19 framework roles
  including infrastructure agents and `context-fixer`) gets the
  custom treatment. The badge is `#a855f7` on white text,
  font-mono, all-caps — matches the [severity] badge style on
  Alerts
- Live verified end-to-end against `trackeros` (commits
  `d0a6927` + `3c6f3c5`):
  - Two custom agents pushed: `docs-check-agent` (checks for
    JSDoc — trackeros already has the JSDoc prompt extension
    on code-agent, so this agent passes with no findings) and
    `usage-example-agent` (guaranteed to flag one `low`-severity
    finding per file, to exercise `LINT_FAILURE` routing)
  - `gestalt agents validate` → `✓ agents.yaml valid (2 custom
    agents defined)`
  - `gestalt agents list` rendered the framework block (9 rows,
    each with its current override / extensions count) +
    custom block (2 rows, both showing platform-default model)
  - Submitted a padEnd intent (correlationId `fbcc2a99`).
    `agent_executions` shows 4 `generate:custom` rows across 2
    gate-retry cycles — `docs-check-agent` completed, passed
    each time; `usage-example-agent` completed with status
    `failed` (passed: false) each time
  - **`signals` table for the cycle has one
    `LINT_FAILURE` per usage-example-agent run** (severity:
    `low`, sourceAgent: `usage-example-agent`, message
    `[usage-example-agent] Missing @example block (verification
    path) (src/shared/utils/pad-end/...)`) — confirms the
    severity-to-signal mapping. The intent reached `deployed`,
    so the gate evaluated the signals + retry budget and let
    the cycle through after the second attempt
  - **Dashboard at `/app/intents/<id>`**: headless Chrome
    confirmed 4 purple `CUSTOM` badges, one per custom-agent
    row, with computed background `rgb(168, 85, 247)` (=
    `#a855f7`, the platform's `--purple`). Custom rows
    interspersed with framework rows in the chronological
    execution list

**Step 1: externalise agent prompts to agents.yaml — implemented.**
- Every LLM-reasoning agent reads its persona (`role`, `goal`), LLM
  tuning (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, optional `model`), and a flat
  list of `prompt_extensions` from `agents.yaml` in the project repo
  root (alongside `HARNESS.json`). Infrastructure agents
  (`constraint-agent`, `test-runner-agent`, `pipeline-agent`,
  `promotion-agent`, `gc-agent`) ignore the file — they do
  deterministic work
- **Schema** (snake_case YAML keys normalised to camelCase by the
  loader; both shapes are accepted):
  ```yaml
  agents:
    code-agent:
      role: "Senior TypeScript engineer"
      goal: "Generate production-quality TypeScript code..."
      llm:
        temperature: 0.2
        max_tokens: 8000
      prompt_extensions:
        - "Always add a JSDoc comment to every exported function"
        - "Use Result<T,E> pattern for error handling"
  ```
- **Loader** (`@gestalt/agents-generate/loadAgentConfig(projectRoot,
  agentRole)`) is fully non-fatal:
  - Missing file → per-role baseline (one of `intent-agent`,
    `design-agent`, `context-agent`, `code-agent`, `test-agent`,
    `review-agent`, `drift-agent`, `alignment-agent`,
    `context-fixer` — matches the seeded YAML exactly)
  - Malformed YAML → baseline + debug log
  - Agent absent from YAML → baseline
  - Partial entry (only `role`, no `llm.temperature`) → merged with
    baseline gap-fill
  - Backward compat: existing projects without an `agents.yaml`
    committed get identical behaviour to before this change
- **ContextSnapshot.agentConfig** added. The context-assembler calls
  `loadAgentConfig(projectRoot, forAgent)` once per agent dispatch
  and attaches the result. The `agents.yaml` is read from the
  per-cycle clone, so an operator can edit + push and the next
  intent cycle picks it up without a server restart (ADR-032)
- **Prompt wrapping** via the `applyAgentConfig(body, agentConfig)`
  helper. Every prompt builder
  (`buildIntentPrompt` / `buildDesignPrompt` / `buildContextPrompt` /
  `buildCodePrompt` / `buildTestPrompt` /
  `buildLintConfigPrompt`) now prepends a single persona line
  (`You are <role> working on the Gestalt platform. Your goal:
  <goal>`) and appends `## Project-specific instructions\n- ext1\n
  - ext2 ...` near the end (when the operator's
  `promptExtensions` array is non-empty). The existing prompt
  body — file paths, JSON output shapes, retry guidance — stays
  intact. `llm-review-agent.ts` and `context-fixer.ts` follow the
  same pattern inline (different surrounding architecture; same
  effect)
- **LLM tuning + per-agent model routing** flow through a shared
  `LlmCallFn` type:
  `(prompt, overrides?: { temperature?, maxTokens?, model? }) =>
  Promise<string>`. The orchestrator's `llmCall` wrapper calls
  `getLLMClient(overrides.model)` per invocation — the registry
  returns the cached default client when `model` is undefined
  or matches the platform default, and creates + caches a new
  client (sharing the default's `baseUrl` + `apiKey`) on first
  use of any other model name. Each agent passes
  `task.contextSnapshot.agentConfig.llm` so per-agent
  `temperature`, `max_tokens`, AND `model` land on the wire
- **Multi-client LLM registry (`@gestalt/core/src/llm/index.ts`).**
  The startup singleton is now a `Map<string, LLMClient>` keyed
  by model name. `createLLMClient(config)` seeds the default;
  `getLLMClient(model?)` returns the cached client for the
  requested model name or builds a new one on demand. Override
  clients reuse the default's endpoint + API key — only the
  model name changes on the wire (matches Azure deployment +
  every OpenAI-compatible provider's contract). `LLMClient.getModel()`
  exposes the bound model name so the orchestrators can capture
  it after each call. Per-process cache — one entry per unique
  model, created on first use, reused forever after
- **`agent_execution_logs.model_used` column (migration 009).**
  Captures which model actually ran each agent step (after the
  per-agent override resolution). The orchestrators read
  `client.getModel()` after every `complete()` call and persist
  it. Null for non-LLM agents (constraint-agent / pr-agent /
  pipeline-agent / promotion-agent / skipped lint-config) and
  for pre-migration-009 rows. Dashboard's IntentDetail panel
  shows `Model: gpt-4o-mini` / `gpt-4o` / `—` in the agent
  meta section
- **`gestalt init` seeds `agents.yaml`** in the harness file map
  (alongside `HARNESS.json` / `AGENTS.md` / context files). The
  seeded content matches the loader's per-role defaults exactly,
  so a project with the seed file and a project without it
  behave identically out of the box. Operators tune by editing +
  pushing
- **`HarnessEngine.validate()` recognises `agents.yaml` as
  optional.** Present + parses cleanly → no warning. Present +
  malformed → `HarnessValidationResult.warnings` carries
  `"agents.yaml parse error: ..."`. Present + missing `agents`
  key → `"agents.yaml present but has no agents key — defaults
  will be used"`. Absent → silent (the common case for projects
  registered before this change). Validation NEVER fails on
  agents.yaml — the loader's defaults always carry the cycle
- Live verified on `trackeros`:
  - **Without `agents.yaml`** (the existing trackeros state at
    commit `198aff6`): submitted an intent; `agent_execution_logs`
    rows for intent / design / code / test agents each show the
    new persona line at the top of the prompt — every agent gets
    its own per-role baseline (`Senior software architect` /
    `Senior software architect` / `Senior TypeScript engineer` /
    `Senior QA engineer`), not a generic placeholder
  - **With `agents.yaml`** committed to trackeros main, setting
    `code-agent.llm.temperature: 0.8` and
    `prompt_extensions: ["Always add a JSDoc comment to every
    exported function", "Use Result<T,E> pattern for error
    handling"]`: submitted a slugify intent; the code-agent's
    persisted prompt shows both extensions under
    `## Project-specific instructions`. **The generated
    `src/shared/utils/slugify.ts` carries the operator's style
    rules verbatim** — a 4-line JSDoc block with `@param` /
    `@returns` tags AND a `Result<string, Error>` return type
    (the LLM even synthesised a helper
    `src/modules/Utils/result.ts` to provide the type)
  - The full cycle (generate → gate → deploy) reached the
    `deployed` status with the operator-tuned extensions in
    play. End-to-end working

**Alert system — enriched payload + fix-intent flow + CLI:**
- `GET /alerts` and `GET /alerts/:id` return `{ data: EnrichedAlert[] }`
  (the standard envelope). Each row carries the base `AlertRecord`
  shape plus per-type fields lifted out of the JSONB `context`
  column so the dashboard / CLI can render without re-parsing:
  - `clarification-needed` → `intentText`, `intentStatus` (looked
    up via `intents.findById(context.intentId)`)
  - `maintenance-stuck` → `findingType`, `affectedFiles`,
    `evidence`, `attemptCount`, `suggestedAction` (lifted from
    `context`)
  - `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` → `breachMessage`, `breachLocation`,
    `breachAgent` (resolved via `signals.findByCorrelationId(alert.
    correlationId)` → pick the `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` row)
- `POST /alerts/:id/fix-intent { additionalContext? }` — operator
  says "I understand the problem, generate a fix". The server
  builds the intent text from the alert's enriched context, queues
  a `generate:intent` task on the BullMQ queue (same shape as
  `POST /intents`), acknowledges the alert in the same call so the
  card disappears atomically, writes an `alert.fix-intent-submitted`
  audit row (metadata: `fixIntentId`, `additionalContextLength`,
  `intentTextLength`, `ip` — **never the context text itself per
  GP-006**), and returns `{ intentId, correlationId, intentText }`.
  `additionalContext` is **appended** to the auto-built text, never
  replaces it — the alert's structural context always leads.
  Intent text templates:
  - `clarification-needed` → `Fix the following issue with intent
    "X": <description>. <additionalContext>`
  - `maintenance-stuck` → `<suggestedAction>. Context: <evidence>.
    <additionalContext>`
  - `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` → `Fix golden principle breach in
    <file>: <breachMessage>. <additionalContext>`
- `POST /alerts/:id/acknowledge { notes? }` extended to accept an
  optional notes body. Audit metadata captures `notesLength` only
  — the text stays on the alert / persisted record, not in the
  audit row (GP-006)
- **Dashboard `Alerts.tsx` rewritten with per-type cards**
  (`packages/dashboard/src/views/Alerts.tsx`). Each card has a
  distinct layout matching the alert's information needs:
  - `clarification-needed` — intent quote + status + "Why paused"
    prose + suggestions bullet list + two action blocks:
    "Provide clarification (resumes the existing intent)" with
    `resume intent ▶` (existing `POST /intents/:id/clarify` flow,
    kept intact) AND "Or submit as a new intent" with
    `submit fix intent ▶` (new `POST /alerts/:id/fix-intent`)
  - `maintenance-stuck` — Agent + Finding + Attempts KV header,
    "What was tried" (`suggestedAction`), Affected files list,
    Evidence prose; single action block "Submit a fix intent" +
    optional context textarea
  - `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` — Detected by + Location KV header,
    "What happened" prose, File + Line KV; single action block
    "Submit a fix intent"
  - Every card also shows a "Dismiss (acknowledge without action)"
    action block with optional notes textarea + red `dismiss`
    button. Per-alert UI state (textarea content, submission mode,
    confirmation banner) is keyed by `alert.id` so opening
    multiple cards at once doesn't share input
- **CLI surface — `gestalt alerts`.** Four subcommands so
  operators can work without the dashboard:
  - `gestalt alerts list` — prints a table of unacknowledged
    alerts for the current project (resolved from
    `~/.gestalt/config.json` `currentProjectId`, with the same
    `[severity]` colour-coding the dashboard uses); empty list
    prints `✓ No unacknowledged alerts`
  - `gestalt alerts show <id>` — full per-type detail panel
    (Title / Description / per-type extras / Available actions
    footer). Accepts either the full UUID or the first 8 chars
    (same 8-char prefix the list table shows). Ambiguous
    prefix errors with the match count
  - `gestalt alerts fix <id> [--context <text>]` — submits a fix
    intent via `POST /alerts/:id/fix-intent`. Prompts for the
    optional context via `prompt()` when `--context` is not
    supplied (consistent with `gestalt init-admin`). Prints the
    new `intentId` / `correlationId` / first 80 chars of the
    `intentText` + a `gestalt status` hint
  - `gestalt alerts dismiss <id> [--notes <text>]` — acknowledges
    without action via `POST /alerts/:id/acknowledge`. Prompts
    for notes when `--notes` is not supplied
  - All four accept the standard `--server <url>` one-shot
    override; project scoping matches the dashboard's
    client-side join on `context.intentId` against the current
    project's intents (plus the direct `context.projectId`
    short-circuit for `maintenance-stuck`)
- Live verified end-to-end against `trackeros`:
  - Two `maintenance-stuck` alerts existed in the DB from the
    prior session. `gestalt alerts list` showed the table with
    `[medium]` badges, `maintenance-stuck` type column, and the
    8-char id; `gestalt alerts show b2260ec2` printed Finding /
    Attempts / Affected files / Suggested action / Evidence
  - `gestalt alerts fix b2260ec2 --context "(operator note)"`
    submitted a fresh `intents` row (`source: 'human'`, status
    `generating`), acknowledged the alert atomically, audit row
    captured `additionalContextLength: 48` + `intentTextLength:
    291` + `fixIntentId` (no text leakage)
  - `gestalt alerts dismiss bf44dc0a --notes "..."` acknowledged
    the second alert; audit captured `notesLength: 51` only
  - Submitted a fresh "make it better" intent to create a
    `clarification-needed` alert; `gestalt alerts show` enriched
    correctly with `intentText: "make it better"` /
    `intentStatus: waiting-for-clarification` / 3 suggestions
  - Drove the dashboard at `/app/alerts` with headless Chrome:
    the new clarification card rendered exactly per the brief —
    `?` glyph + `CLARIFICATION NEEDED` + `[high]` badge + intent
    quote / status KV + Why paused prose + suggestions list + 3
    stacked action blocks (Resume / Submit-as-new / Dismiss)

**Pending enhancements (design in chat first):**
- **Return-URL preservation across login.** Pasting `/app/intents/<id>`
  in a fresh tab today bounces to `/app/login` and after sign-in
  lands on `/app/` (the intent ID is dropped). Small SPA-only change —
  `useLocation()` + `?from=` query param in the `RequireAuth` Navigate
  and the Login view's post-success `navigate(...)`. ~10 minutes
- **Vite dev-server proxy `/api` entry is dead.** The proxy in
  `packages/dashboard/vite.config.ts` forwards `/api → localhost:3000`
  but the server has no routes under `/api`. Pre-existing dead
  config; remove on the next dashboard-config touch
- **Encrypt Git PATs at rest.** `project_git_credentials.token` is plain
  text. Documented TODO in `repositories/projects.ts`. Pick a key-management
  approach before any shared/production use
- **LLM model name validation.** `loadConfig` accepts any non-empty string
  for `LLM_MODEL`. Worth adding a startup-time ping or clear error path
- Non-interactive mode for `gestalt init-admin` (--email/--password flags)
  for scripted use — current implementation is TTY-only
- **Retry cycle full re-runs all generate agents** even though only the
  routed agents need fresh work (code-agent typically). Cheaper retries
  would skip intent/design/context when their prior artifacts are
  present in the Git tip. For now: ~50-60s per retry cycle. Tracked as
  an optimisation, not a correctness gap
- **Read `qualityGate.maxRetries` from the project's HARNESS.json** —
  currently hardcoded to 3 in both the gate and generate orchestrators
- **Other PipelineAdapter implementations** (Azure DevOps, GitLab CI,
  Jenkins). The interface is in place; only `GitHubActions` + `NoOp`
  are implemented today. `GitHubActions` is verified end-to-end (see
  `67e5ee02` cycle in the session log); the others are typed stubs in
  the `PipelineAdapterType` union but have no implementation
- **`set-adapter` only switches `pipeline.adapter` today.** The
  `POST /projects/:id/config` body shape is generic
  (`{ pipeline?: ... }`) — adding monitoring (`maintenance.monitoring.adapter`)
  and `qualityGate.maxRetries` follows the same whitelist + clone-edit-
  commit pattern but is not implemented yet
- **Promotion workflow dispatches against a hardcoded `'main'` ref.**
  `GitHubActionsAdapter.promoteToEnvironment` always sends
  `{"ref":"main",...}` instead of the project's `defaultBranch`.
  Projects on `master`/`trunk`/etc. will see the promotion workflow
  fail to dispatch. Thread `project.defaultBranch` through the
  promotion-agent → adapter call to fix
- **No proactive PAT-scope validation at registration / set-adapter
  time.** A PAT missing `workflow` scope only surfaces on the first
  pipeline dispatch (`GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` signal + intent
  `escalated`). A startup-time `GET /user` + `GET /repos/:o/:r` ping
  in `init-harness` / `set-adapter` would catch the misconfiguration
  before any intent cycle
- **Promotion strategy beyond auto.** Today both staging → production
  fires unconditionally on a passed pipeline. The `EnvironmentStrategy`
  type already supports `trigger: 'manual'` + `approvals: N`; wire that
  through promotion-agent once a human-approval UI exists
- **Real-tooling gate agents** (typecheck via `tsc`, lint via ESLint,
  tests via `vitest`). Each needs the project's deps installed in the
  cloned tree — likely a `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` step before
  the agents run, with the install output cached
- **Live Prometheus / Datadog adapters not yet exercised.** Built
  against the published REST API shapes; unit-tested smoke would
  require a monitoring system. NoOp adapter is the verified path
- **drift-agent additive note can churn DOMAIN.md** if the agent runs
  daily and the module keeps changing. Should de-dupe against existing
  notes (the current `includes(note)` check uses the exact day, so the
  next day's note appears as a new line — fine for low-volume
  projects, may need rolling-window dedupe for active ones)
