# STATE.md — current platform state

_Concise capability snapshot. For HOW each capability was built,
see [sessions/RECENT.md](./sessions/RECENT.md) (last 3 sessions) or
the `sessions/archive/` files (everything older)._

**Last updated:** 2026-06-07 (after TR_022 — scaffolding fixes + phase retry budget + live re-test of the planning loop on a 5-phase feature. Migration 025 adds `feature_phases.retry_count`. `HarnessConfig.planner` gains `maxPhaseRetries` (default 2). `handlePlanningEvaluate` rewritten: on phase failure, re-dispatches `planning:phase` for the same phase until the budget is exhausted; only then marks the feature blocked. trackeros tsconfig.json gets `resolveJsonModule` + `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`; HARNESS.json + template get a `no require() for JSON imports` code-agent rule. Template 0.8.0 → 0.9.0. **Live verified**: feature `1a5dcfc5` (leave management, 5 phases) exercised the retry budget end-to-end (3 attempts on phase 1, all failing on Aider DTO-field hallucination — not a planning bug); feature `37799ea9` (test flag flip) proved the per-phase architecture pass fires when `architectureReviewPerPhase: true`.

## What is built and verified

### Platform foundations

- All 13 buildable packages compile (`pnpm -r build`).
- `docker-compose up -d` brings server + postgres + redis healthy.
- All 25 migrations apply on first start.
- Server reachable on `http://localhost:3000`; `/health` returns 200;
  protected routes return 401 without a JWT.
- Dashboard SPA served at `/app/*`; shareable deep-link URLs work.
- First-boot bootstrap verified: `gestalt init-admin` → `gestalt login`
  → `/auth/me` returns the user.

### Five SDLC layers (all wired end-to-end)

- **generate** — intent → design → context → lint-config → code → test;
  custom agents in `agents.yaml` interleave via `runs_after`.
- **quality-gate** — constraint-agent + review-agent (both LLM,
  ADR-041 — gate runs AFTER CI, not before pr-agent). Gate clones
  the PR branch, checks it out, and reads source files directly
  from the working tree (`readFromBranch: true`). On pass dispatches
  `deploy:promotion` (staging); on fail forwards `resumeOnBranch`
  so the retry leg pushes to the same PR. Verdict:
  `pass` / `fail` (auto-retry) / `escalate` (GP_BREACH).
  Max gate retries: 3. Pre-CI lint/security/test-runner stubs
  deleted — CI uses the project's own ESLint / Vitest / Semgrep
  via the comprehensive `gestalt.yml` workflow template.
- **deploy** — pr-agent → pipeline-agent → promotion-agent
  (staging → production). `PipelineAdapter` interface;
  `GitHubActionsAdapter` + `NoOpPipelineAdapter` implemented.
  ADR-034 production-requires-staging enforced. Auto-merge supported
  via `pipeline.autoMerge` in HARNESS.json.
- **maintenance** — drift / alignment / gc / evaluation, scheduled via
  `node-cron`. Context-file intents take a direct-fix path via
  context-fixer (path-guarded to `docs/*` + `AGENTS.md`).
  `MonitoringAdapter` (Prometheus / Datadog / NoOp).
- **planning** (migration 024) — three agents (architecture-agent /
  planner-agent / phase-evaluator-agent) drive an autonomous feature
  decomposition loop. Operator submits a feature; orchestrator clones
  the repo, runs architecture-agent for the high-level design, runs
  planner-agent for the phase plan, commits `PLAN.md` + appends to
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, then dispatches phase 1 as a regular
  `generate:intent`. The in-process event bus subscriber maps each
  phase intent's terminal status (`deployed` / `failed`) into a
  `planning:evaluate` dispatch; phase-evaluator-agent decides whether
  to continue, adjust remaining phases, or escalate. Bounded by
  `HARNESS.json.planner` (`maxPhasesPerFeature`, `maxFilesPerPhase`,
  `architectureReviewPerPhase`). All LLM guidance prose lives in
  `agents.yaml` (`prompt_extensions`) + `HARNESS.json.agentConfig`
  (`rules` / `architectureGuidance` / `phaseScopingRules` /
  `evaluationCriteria`) per ADR-042 — `.ts` carries only structural
  framing + JSON schemas.

### Identity + auth

- Local auth (non-production only, ADR-025).
- Kerberos / SAML / OIDC providers (ADR-024); `auth.config.json`
  primary source, HARNESS.json `identity` block fallback (ADR-040).
- Two-tier role model: platform roles (`platform-admin` | `user`),
  project roles (`project-admin` | `editor` | `reader`).
- Platform groups for bulk assignment (Brief 1, migration 018);
  effective project role = max of direct + group-derived.
- Server-side membership enforcement on every read + write endpoint;
  no-enumeration-leak rule (empty array, not 403).
- Hot-reload of identity providers without server restart
  (`POST /platform/identity/reload`).

### Platform admin surfaces

- **Users** — CRUD + deactivate + self-protection guards.
- **Projects** — platform-admin create / delete (with active-intents
  guard) / list with cross-project enrichment (members / intents /
  last activity).
- **Groups** — CRUD, members, project assignments with role
  precedence.
- **LLM registry** (migration 014) — per-row baseUrl / apiKeyEnv /
  apiShape (`chat-completions` vs `responses` for gpt-5/o1/o3).
- **Secrets vault** (migrations 015+016) — AES-256-GCM encrypted,
  master key at `/etc/gestalt/master.key` or
  `GESTALT_MASTER_KEY` env; rotation tooling (migration 021).
- **Self-healing** (migration 020) — 7 per-failure-type configs;
  diagnostician picks `retryTaskType` + hints; alerts auto-resolve
  at high confidence.
- **Templates** — harness templates table (migration 017) +
  download / duplicate / edit / push / diff (dashboard + CLI).
  Built-in templates read-only; duplicate first to customise.
- **MCP servers** — platform-wide MCP servers (`platform_mcp_servers`).
- **Self-healing** + **identity** dashboard tabs.

### Project lifecycle

- `gestalt init` registers project; server clones repo, generates
  stack config via LLM (`generateStackConfig`), substitutes
  variables into harness template, commits + pushes.
- Phase-1 project description accepts multi-line input via a
  three-mode chooser (single-line default / END-terminated /
  `$EDITOR`). The full body is passed verbatim into
  `generateStackConfig` and into the template's
  `{{projectDescription}}` substitution. Template engine
  JSON-escapes substituted values when the target file is `.json`
  (engine.ts `substitute(..., { jsonEscape: true })`) so newlines
  + quotes + control chars in the description land safely inside
  HARNESS.json string literals; markdown / yaml files keep raw
  newlines.
- Vault-backed Git PATs (migration 022) — operators link a vault
  secret to a project; resolver decrypts server-side per-cycle.
- GitHub repo browser via `/platform/git/repos` proxy.
- Dynamic harness — LLM picks language / framework / package
  manager / test runner at init time.

### Agent infrastructure

- `BaseLLMAgent` in `@gestalt/core/agents` — every LLM-using agent
  in every layer extends it. Captures `lastPrompt` /
  `lastLlmResponse` / `lastModelUsed` / `lastTokensUsed`
  (accumulated across every LLM call inside one `run()`).
- Built-in file tools (ADR-038, migration 012): `readFile`,
  `listDirectory`, `searchFiles`, `getFileTree`. Read-only,
  path-traversal-guarded.
- MCP integration (ADR-039) — external tool servers per-agent in
  `agents.yaml`. Namespace prefix prevents collision with built-ins.
- Per-agent LLM model override + tools.builtin + tools.mcp +
  prompt_extensions, all driven by `agents.yaml` in the project repo.
- Custom agents (ADR-037) — prompt-only LLM runners declared by the
  project; topo-sorted via `runs_after`.
- Section-based prompts (architecture / constraints / scope /
  design / intent / principles / domain / signals / task) — every
  LLM-generating agent opens with non-negotiable rules.

### Observability + operator surfaces

- Per-agent `agent_executions` + `agent_execution_logs` rows
  (migration 007 + 009 + 012) with prompt / response / model /
  tool calls / **tokens used** (BaseLLMAgent's `lastTokensUsed`
  accumulator wired through the generate + gate orchestrators
  on 2026-06-04; deploy + maintenance are non-LLM today).
- Live event bus (`@gestalt/core/events`) → SSE at
  `/events`. Dashboard subscribes for instant updates.
- IntentDetail accordion with prompt + LLM response + tool calls
  + signals + artifacts.
- Active agents card with cycle progress + token totals.
- Deployments view: 4/5-node pipeline timeline (5th node for
  auto-merged cycles).
- Maintenance view: per-run findings expansion panel.
- Alerts: per-type bodies + interventions (ADR-021).
- Pipeline failure alerts with operator feedback → resume on the
  same branch (migration 019).
- Operator-driven CLI parity: `gestalt run --watch` /
  `gestalt intent / gate / deploy / agents active /
  maintenance / status --graph --watch`.

### CLI

- Bootstrap: `init-admin`, `login`, `init`, `run`, `status`, `logs`.
- Project: `projects list/use/set-adapter/update-token`;
  `project config show/set-agent/set-pipeline/add-custom-agent/...`
- Alerts: `alerts list/show/fix/dismiss/resume/abort/acknowledge/
  pipeline-feedback`.
- Platform admin (gated to platform-admin): `users`,
  `platform llms / secrets / projects / templates / mcp /
  tools / identity / groups / self-healing`.
- Intent: `intent list/show/submit` with `--watch` + filters
  (`--source`, `--priority`, `--search`, `--from`, `--to`).
- Templates push + diff (added 2026-06-04).
- Shared multi-line prompt helpers in `@gestalt/cli/ui/prompts`:
  `promptMultiline` / `promptWithEditor` /
  `promptMultilineDescription`. Used by `gestalt init` (Phase 1
  description) and `gestalt project config add-custom-agent`
  (prompt body). Backwards-compatible single-line default.

---

## Implemented with caveats

- **Quality-gate** — ADR-041 (TR_018): pre-CI lint / security /
  test-runner stubs were deleted. Gate now runs `constraint-agent`
  + `review-agent` AFTER CI passes, reading source files directly
  from the PR branch. CI owns lint / unit-tests / security scan
  via the project's own tooling.
- **Deploy** — `GitHubActionsAdapter` + `NoOpPipelineAdapter` are
  the only implementations. Azure DevOps / GitLab CI / Jenkins
  are typed stubs in the `PipelineAdapterType` union.
- **Maintenance** — `Prometheus` / `Datadog` `MonitoringAdapter`
  implementations exist but aren't yet verified against a real
  monitoring instance. NoOp is the verified path.
- **Identity** — Local + OIDC verified end-to-end via the
  Keycloak fixture. SAML compiles + the route shape is verified
  but full end-to-end against a real IdP only exercised once.
  Kerberos provider compiles; not exercised end-to-end (needs a
  real AD + krb5.keytab).

---

## What is not yet built

- `@gestalt/adapter-oracle` — every repository method throws.
- `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` — every repository method throws.
- `@gestalt/registry` — types + client only; no server, no UI.
- Non-GitHub `PipelineAdapter` impls (Azure DevOps / GitLab CI /
  Jenkins).
- GitLab / Azure DevOps / Bitbucket support in
  `/platform/git/repos` (GitHub only today).
- LDAP group lookup for Kerberos identities (Kerberos tickets
  carry user only; groups need AD query).

---

## Active follow-ups (small)

### PLANNING_LAYER — Autonomous feature decomposition (migration 024)

New `@gestalt/agents-planning` package + `planning:start` / `planning:phase`
/ `planning:evaluate` task types on a new `gestalt-planning` BullMQ
queue. Three new agent roles (architecture-agent / planner-agent /
phase-evaluator-agent), three new postgres tables (features /
feature_phases / feature_plan_log), `POST /features` route, and
`gestalt feature submit/list/show` CLI commands. The orchestrator
loop: clone repo → architecture-agent → planner-agent → write
PLAN.md → commit + push → dispatch phase 1 as `generate:intent` →
event-bus subscriber catches terminal status → planning:evaluate
→ phase-evaluator-agent → either next phase, mark feature
completed, or block. Strict ADR-042 compliance — every guidance
prose string lives in `agents.yaml.prompt_extensions` or
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig[role]` (`rules` / `architectureGuidance`
/ `phaseScopingRules` / `evaluationCriteria`); only structural
framing + JSON schemas live in `packages/agents/planning/src/prompts/`.
Live verified on trackeros: feature `ea19b18e` ran the full loop
end-to-end against real GitHub Actions CI (CI failed due to a
pre-existing code-agent issue; the planning loop correctly marked
the phase failed and the feature blocked). Template bumped
0.7.0 → 0.8.0.

### TR_021 — Externalise verificationGuidance to HARNESS.json

Refactor (kept brief; see `sessions/RECENT.md` for the full
narrative). Lifted project-specific "HOW to verify before
flagging" hints out of `llm-review-agent.ts` and into
`HARNESS.json.agentConfig[role].verificationGuidance`. PLANNING_LAYER
extended the same helper to render three more sub-section types
(phaseScopingRules, evaluationCriteria, architectureGuidance).
Template went 0.6.0 → 0.7.0 → 0.8.0.

### TR_020 — Real GitHub Actions deploy works end-to-end

trackeros's first `Status: ✓ deployed` against the real
`github-actions` adapter — 1m 58s, single round, PR #54
squash-merged. See `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_020.md`.

### Resolved by TR_020 (kept brief)

Gate retry budget threading + ABSOLUTE_MAX_RETRIES + CI dedupe
all resolved. See `docs/claude/TEST_REPORT_020.md` for the full
diff.

### Active follow-ups (carryover or NEW)

- **(HIGH — NEW from TR_022)** Aider DTO-field hallucination —
  Aider's generated repository / service code references fields
  not present on the DTO (e.g. `Property 'employeeId' does not
  exist on type 'CreateLeaveRequestDto'`). Three consecutive
  attempts on the leave-management feature's phase 1 all
  produced the same class of error; the retry budget bailed
  cleanly, but the feature didn't progress. Either extend the
  code-agent prompt with a "READ the DTO file first" rule or
  require model + repository in the same Aider call. Tracked
  as TR_023.
- **(LOW — NEW from TR_022)** `readMaxPhaseRetries` re-clones
  HARNESS.json on every failure dispatch. Cheap (~250ms) but
  could be cached per-feature for the lifecycle.
- **~~(MEDIUM — PLANNING_LAYER)~~ RESOLVED by TR_022.**
  Phase failure → feature blocked was too eager. Now bounded
  by `planner.maxPhaseRetries` (default 2) and verified live
  on feature `1a5dcfc5`.
- **~~(MEDIUM — PLANNING_LAYER)~~ RESOLVED by TR_022.**
  Original Aider `resolveJsonModule` failure mode addressed
  in trackeros tsconfig + template default code-agent rule.
- **~~(LOW — PLANNING_LAYER)~~ RESOLVED by TR_022.** Per-phase
  architecture review verified live on feature `37799ea9`.
- **(LOW — NEW from PLANNING_LAYER)** The orchestrator stores
  phase scope adjustments under `feature_phases.result.pendingScopeAdjustment`
  and the next `planning:phase` reads them when assembling the
  intent text. The scope itself never overwrites the original
  `scope` column — by design, so the planner's first draft stays
  visible to operators. Consider a dedicated `scope_history` array
  if operators need a full history.
- **(LOW — NEW from TR_021)** Consider migrating the
  `consistencySection` block (cross-artifact checks:
  test-framework match, import resolution, @types/* coverage,
  test-file placement) out of `llm-review-agent.ts`'s
  `buildReviewPrompt` into HARNESS.json verificationGuidance.
  Borderline platform-mechanic / project-specific; works fine
  in code today but a non-Node project might want to tune it.
- **(LOW — NEW from TR_021, structurally addressed)** The TR_020
  "extend trust-CI to constraint-agent" item is now a one-line
  edit to `agentConfig['constraint-agent'].verificationGuidance`
  in HARNESS.json. Not added in TR_021 because constraint-agent
  doesn't currently hit the hallucination; documented here so
  the next regression can be fixed without a code change.
- **(MEDIUM — TR_019, still relevant)** `gestalt init` should
  scaffold a `.gitignore` + align jest/ts-jest/@types/jest
  versions with TypeScript. trackeros's jest@27 + TS@5 mismatch
  was latent under `noop`; same scaffolding should align Node 22.
- **(LOW — TR_019, still relevant)** Template
  `{{ciSetupSteps}}` for Node/npm should add `--legacy-peer-deps`
  on `npm install` until the upstream npm arborist
  `Link.matches` bug is fixed.
- **(LOW — TR_019, still relevant)** Add a `tsc --noEmit` sanity
  check on scaffolded tests in `gestalt init`.

### Carryovers (TR_018 / TR_014)

- **(HIGH — TR_018)** Restore the TR_010 mandatory `executeScript
  tsc --noEmit` code-agent rule on trackeros's HARNESS.json. CI's
  `Compile` step catches the same errors post-hoc but the rule
  catches them pre-emit during Aider's generation.
- **(MEDIUM — TR_014)** Aider token-spend visibility. Parse
  `Tokens: N sent / M received` from Aider's stdout. code-agent
  rows still show 0 tokens across all rounds.

### Architecture follow-ups (all LOW unless marked)

Pruned to top items; see `sessions/archive/` for the full
historical list.

- Retry cycle full re-runs all generate agents — skip
  intent/design/context when artifacts in Git tip.
- `qualityGate.maxRetries` + `planner.maxPhasesPerFeature`
  hardcoded fallbacks (3 / 10) — wire through HARNESS reads
  for projects that override.
- Promotion workflow dispatches against hardcoded `'main'` ref.
  Projects on `master` / `trunk` will fail.
- No proactive PAT-scope validation at registration.
- Encrypt Git PATs at rest in legacy `project_git_credentials`.
- LLM model name not validated at startup.
- (MEDIUM, TR_004) test-agent punts on method coverage.

---

## Operator caveats / pending actions

### trackeros state (current)

- **trackeros `main`** at commit `b99e1716` (post-TR_022
  HARNESS.json restored — `architectureReviewPerPhase: false`,
  `maxPhaseRetries: 2`). Pipeline adapter `github-actions` +
  autoMerge true. tsconfig.json carries `resolveJsonModule` +
  `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.
- **PR cleanup**: TR_019 + PLANNING_LAYER stranded PRs (#49–#52,
  #57) closed with `--delete-branch` during TR_022. New PRs from
  TR_022's verification cycles (#58–#62) currently open under
  the blocked leave-management feature — leave until TR_023
  lands the Aider DTO fix.
- **Re-create vault secret for OpenAI API key** if the operator
  wants vault-backed routing. Both LLMs currently in env-var
  mode (`apiKeyEnv: 'LLM_API_KEY'`) and working.
- **Open alerts to dismiss**: cycle alerts from TR_010–TR_019.
  Dismissable with `gestalt alerts dismiss <id>`.
- **`.env`**: `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o` (operator default).
- **`master.key`** generated locally (workspace root, mode 600,
  gitignored) + mounted into the container via
  `docker-compose.yml`. Survives `docker compose up -d --build`.
  Back up out-of-band; losing it makes every vault-encrypted
  secret unreadable.

## CLI install

`@gestalt/cli` is private — not on npm.
```bash
pnpm --filter @gestalt/cli build && cd packages/cli && npm link
```

---

## First-boot sequence

1. `docker-compose up -d` — start platform.
2. `gestalt init-admin` — create admin user (TTY only, once
   per server).
3. `gestalt login` — authenticate CLI.
4. `mkdir my-project && cd my-project && git init && git remote
   add origin <url>`.
5. `gestalt init` — register project + server pushes harness.
6. `git pull` — receive harness files locally.
7. `gestalt run "<intent>"` — submit work to agents.
