## Current state (keep this section current)

**Last updated:** 2026-05-31 (Claude Code — `/projects` returns all projects, not owner-only; defensive 401 → /login)

**Repo:** https://github.com/afarahat-lab/gestalt

**What is built and working:**
- All 8 architecture layers fully designed and documented
- **All four SDLC layers fully implemented end-to-end:** generate,
  quality-gate, deploy, maintenance. The closed loop runs:
  `human intent → generate → gate → deploy → deployed`, plus
  `maintenance scheduler → queues typed MaintenanceIntent → back into
  generate`. See per-layer detail bullets below; per-agent run lifecycles
  are summarised in the "Session log" entries dated 2026-05-29 / 30
- All 12 buildable workspace packages compile clean (`pnpm -r build`)
- `docker-compose up -d` succeeds — server, postgres, redis all `Up (healthy)`
- All six migrations apply on startup: `001_initial`, `002_local_auth`,
  `003_projects`, `004_deployments`, `005_maintenance`,
  `006_intent_clarification`
- Server reachable on http://localhost:3000 — `/health` returns 200
- Auth middleware active — protected routes return 401
- **Dashboard SPA reachable in the browser, deep-linkable, no path
  collisions with the API.** `gestalt dashboard` opens
  `<serverUrl>/app/`; the server serves the React SPA from
  `packages/dashboard/dist/` via `fastify-static` mounted at the
  `/app/` prefix. Vite is built with `base: '/app/'` so asset URLs in
  the built `index.html` reference `/app/assets/<hash>.{js,css}`.
  React Router uses `<BrowserRouter basename="/app">`, so every
  `navigate('/intents/${id}')` inside the SPA resolves to
  `/app/intents/${id}` in the URL bar. The API still owns the root
  and bare paths (`/intents/:id`, `/alerts`, etc.) — the URL spaces
  are now fully disjoint, which means **dashboard URLs are
  shareable**: copy from the address bar, paste in a new tab, and
  the dashboard loads that exact view (RequireAuth bounces to
  `/app/login` if no token, otherwise renders the deep-linked
  component). The auth preHandler bypasses GET requests under
  `/app/*` only; non-GET methods always require auth. The bare
  server URL (`/`) issues a 302 redirect to `/app/` for convenience.
  The not-found handler is the SPA fallback only for `/app/*` GETs;
  any other unknown GET (e.g. a typo at `/intnts`) returns 404 JSON
  instead of silently serving the SPA shell (whose asset refs would
  break)
- First-boot bootstrap verified end-to-end: `gestalt init-admin` creates
  admin + JWT; `gestalt login` authenticates; `GET /auth/me` returns user
- **CLI server URL is fully configurable.** `gestalt config show` /
  `gestalt config set-server <url>` / `gestalt config reset` let
  operators inspect and change `~/.gestalt/config.json` without going
  through the auth flow. Every CLI command that contacts the server
  (`login`, `init`, `init-admin`, `run`, `status`, `logs`,
  `dashboard`, `projects list|use|set-adapter`) accepts an optional
  `--server <url>` flag — one-shot override on all of them; only
  `login` and `init-admin` persist the URL to config on success
  (those are the bootstrap commands). All commands route URL
  selection through one helper (`resolveServerUrl`); no remaining
  direct `config.serverUrl` reads in command files. `gestalt status`
  prints the active server URL in its header
  (`Gestalt — http://localhost:3000`). Every connectivity failure
  surfaces the attempted URL through a shared formatter and, when
  the URL is still the local-dev default
  (`http://localhost:3000`), adds a first-run hint nudging the user
  to `gestalt config set-server` + `gestalt login`. URL validation
  (`http://` or `https://` only, trailing slash stripped) lives in
  `normaliseServerUrl`. `gestalt config show` never prints the token
  itself — only `set` / `not set`
- `gestalt init` fully implemented — Git-backed four-phase wizard:
  registers project on server, server clones repo, commits harness files,
  pushes; developer runs `git pull` to receive harness locally
- `gestalt projects list`, `gestalt projects use <name>`, and
  `gestalt projects set-adapter <name> <noop|github-actions>` working.
  `set-adapter` clones the project repo, mutates `pipeline.adapter` in
  `HARNESS.json`, commits as
  `chore: update pipeline adapter to <adapter> [gestalt]`, and pushes
  to `defaultBranch` — HARNESS.json in the repo remains the source of
  truth (ADR-032). Audit-logged as `project.config-updated`
- `gestalt run` queues intent → orchestrator picks up → clones project
  repo fresh per cycle → runs generate loop against cloned harness files
- **Intent clarification flow wired end-to-end.** A vague intent
  (e.g. "make it better") no longer fails silently at the test-agent —
  the intent-agent runs, sees `successCriteria.length === 0` (or a
  high-impact ambiguity), and returns a new typed
  `AgentStatus = 'clarification-needed'` with a `{ reason, suggestions }`
  payload. The orchestrator:
  - creates an `alerts` row (`type: 'clarification-needed'`,
    `severity: high`, `requiredAction: 'provide-clarification'`,
    `context.intentId` + `context.suggestions[]` JSONB-stashed)
  - emits an `alert.created` SSE event so the dashboard updates
    without a refresh
  - transitions the intent to `waiting-for-clarification`
  - flips `plan.state = 'waiting_for_clarification'` so the outer
    while-loop bails before any downstream agent runs
  The maintenance-sourced intent guard (ADR-035 prefix
  `[gestalt-maintenance/<type>]`) short-circuits the clarification
  check — those are typed `MaintenanceIntent` objects and never
  need operator clarification. Dashboard Alerts view renders the
  card with the `?` badge, suggestions list, textarea, and a
  "resume intent" button. Resume flow:
  - `POST /intents/:id/clarify { clarification }` acknowledges every
    unacknowledged `clarification-needed` alert for the
    correlationId, audit-logs the operator's clarification text
    (GP-002), and re-dispatches a `generate:intent` task with
    `clarification` threaded through
  - orchestrator hydrates the missing `projectId` + `text` from
    the persisted intent row, calls `runIntentAgent` with the
    clarification text appended to the prompt under an "Operator
    clarification" heading; downstream agents proceed normally
  - the `intent-agent` clarification gate runs AFTER the LLM call
    (we trust the LLM to drive the decision, not a pre-flight
    regex)
  - Verified live (`61fd59a6`): submitted "make it better" against
    `trackeros`; intent paused in ~2 s, alert visible in dashboard
    with three suggestions, textarea, and resume button; submitted
    "Add a slugify utility under src/shared/utils/slugify with
    slugify(s: string): string"; alert disappeared, cycle resumed,
    all six generate agents ran in ~22 s; intent reached
    `in-review`. Browser screenshots captured of alert card + post-
    submit empty state
  - **Clarification text persists across gate retries
    (migration 006).** `intents.clarification TEXT NULL`;
    `POST /intents/:id/clarify` writes the column via
    `intents.saveClarification(id, text)` BEFORE dispatching the
    resume task. The orchestrator reads `intentRecord.clarification`
    on every dispatch (including the gate-retry leg, whose BullMQ
    payload does not carry the text) and threads it into the
    intent-agent's task. Audit-log records only
    `{ clarificationLength: N, acknowledgedAlertIds, ip }` — the
    text itself never leaves the DB (GP-006). Verified live
    (`63bc2a3b`): intent-agent ran 3 times across the cycle
    (initial pause, post-clarify resume, gate retry); each run
    saw the persisted 156-char clarification; only ONE
    clarification alert was ever created (the original — the
    pre-fix bug would have created a second one on the retry
    leg); intent reached `escalated` for an unrelated review-agent
    GP_BREACH after the second gate review
- **Dashboard Intent Feed now shows ALL intents, including failed
  and waiting-for-clarification.** Pre-existing bug: the feed read
  `projectId` from `localStorage.getItem('gestalt_project')` with
  fallback `'default'` — that string never matched a real
  `project_id` and `listIntents` always returned zero rows (so
  failed intents had no trace in the dashboard). No status filter
  is applied to `listIntents` — the feed shows the full intent
  timeline for the project
- **`GET /projects` returns ALL registered projects** to any
  authenticated user. The previous owner-only filter
  (`projects.list(request.user.id)` → only rows where
  `created_by = userId`) meant that if operator A registered
  `trackeros` and operator B logged into the dashboard, B would
  see "No projects — run gestalt init" even though
  `gestalt projects list` worked for A. Self-hosted small teams
  expect every operator to see every project; the filter has been
  switched to `projects.listAll()`. If per-project access control
  is required later, add a `project_members` table and intersect
  there — do NOT re-introduce the owner-only filter at this
  endpoint
- **ProjectContext defensively redirects to `/app/login` on 401.**
  RequireAuth at the top of the dashboard route tree only checks
  for the presence of a token, not its validity. A stale or
  expired JWT used to bounce every API call to 401, which
  ProjectContext silently caught and rendered as "No projects —
  run gestalt init". The catch block now distinguishes
  `ApiError.status === 401` (delete the token, hard-navigate to
  `/app/login`) from other failures (network down, 500 — keep
  showing the layout, set `projects: []`)
- **Project selection is global across the entire dashboard.**
  `packages/dashboard/src/context/ProjectContext.tsx` fetches
  `/projects` once on mount, hydrates from
  `localStorage.gestalt_project_id` if present, falls back to
  `projects[0]` if the stored id is missing or no longer
  resolves, and persists every change back to `localStorage`. The
  Layout sidebar renders a `<select>` between the logo and the
  navigation links — switching projects there applies
  immediately to every project-scoped view (IntentFeed / Alerts /
  Deployments / QualityGate / Maintenance). ActiveAgents stays
  global (agent executions span all projects). Window-focus
  refetch keeps the project list current when an operator runs
  `gestalt init` in another terminal (no new SSE event needed).
  The earlier per-view fetches and localStorage reads
  (`gestalt_project` with `'default'` fallback in
  Deployments / QualityGate; the per-view dropdown in IntentFeed)
  are removed. Every project-scoped view guards on
  `!currentProjectId` with an EmptyState pointing at
  `gestalt init`. Alerts are project-scoped client-side by
  joining `alert.context.intentId` against the project's intent
  list (the `/alerts` API has no `projectId` filter — captured as
  a Pending enhancement). Verified live: selector renders with
  the existing project pre-selected, the IntentFeed shows
  "3 total · trackeros" with all three intents (escalated +
  needs-input + failed) including the older `failed` one the
  operator originally reported as invisible; all five
  project-scoped views render with the selector value in the
  sidebar across navigations; reload retains the choice; clearing
  localStorage falls back to `projects[0]`; a bogus stored id
  also falls back cleanly
- **Maintenance layer wired end-to-end (ADR-018, ADR-019, ADR-020,
  ADR-035).** Four scheduled agents run in-process via `node-cron`,
  registered as `startMaintenanceScheduler(config)` at server.ts step 9:
  - **drift-agent** (daily 02:00 UTC) — clones the project, finds
    `src/modules/*/...` files changed in the last 30 days, compares
    against the most recent commit timestamp on the global context
    files; for modules drifted by > 7 days appends a timestamped HTML
    comment to `docs/DOMAIN.md` (ADR-018 additive-only exception, direct
    commit + push) and queues a `CONTEXT_UPDATE` MaintenanceIntent
  - **alignment-agent** (daily 03:00 UTC) — reads context files,
    cross-checks DOMAIN.md entities ↔ ARCHITECTURE.md modules, and
    GP-NNN cross-references in AGENTS.md; queues `CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT`
    intents per misalignment
  - **gc-agent** (weekly Fri 04:00 UTC) — deletes remote `gestalt/*`
    branches older than 30 days, `.gestalt/*` spec files older than 90
    days (committed deletion), and `deployment_events` rows older than
    90 days. Never queues intents
  - **evaluation-agent** (every 15 min) — resolves the project's
    `MonitoringAdapter` from HARNESS.json; queries error rate / p99
    latency / alert count; queues `PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION` or
    `SECURITY_FINDING` intents on threshold breach. Dedupe guard skips
    any candidate whose `[gestalt-maintenance/<type>]` prefix already
    appears on an open intent (status `pending` / `generating`)
  - All four agents share a runner (`runMaintenanceAgent`) that creates
    a `maintenance_runs` row, dispatches queued intents into the
    `gestalt-generate` queue with `source: 'maintenance-agent'` and the
    operator-supplied `suggestedAction` as intent text, updates the row
    on completion, and emits a `maintenance.run-completed` SSE event
  - Manual operator trigger via `POST /maintenance/trigger { agentRole,
    projectId }` (requireRole operator); same runner code path as the
    cron schedules
  - `GET /maintenance/runs?projectId&agentRole&limit` returns
    `MaintenanceRunRecord[]`
  - Live verification against `trackeros`: all 4 agents triggered;
    alignment-agent produced 5 findings → 5 maintenance intents
    queued (all carrying `[gestalt-maintenance/CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT]`
    prefix; generate orchestrator picked them up immediately); other
    agents returned 0 findings as expected on this small repo
- **Deploy layer v1 wired end-to-end (ADR-033, ADR-034).** A `pass`
  verdict on the quality gate now dispatches `deploy:pr` to the new
  deploy-orchestrator (`startDeployWorker` registered at server.ts
  step 8). The generate orchestrator no longer mutates the project's
  Git tree — pr-agent owns the only commit + push, to a PR branch,
  never to `defaultBranch`. The deploy worker drains
  `bull:gestalt-deploy:*` and chains three agents:
  - **pr-agent** — clones the project, cuts
    `gestalt/<corr8>-<slug>` (intent's first 5 words, kebab-cased,
    capped at 40 chars), writes artifacts, commits + pushes, opens a
    PR via the resolved `PipelineAdapter`. Transitions intent
    `approved → deploying`. Writes a `pr-opened` row to
    `deployment_events`, emits `deployment.updated` with `prUrl` +
    `prNumber`
  - **pipeline-agent** — triggers the adapter's pipeline, polls
    `getPipelineStatus` every 15s (up to 10 min). On `passed` writes
    `pipeline-passed`. On `failed`/`cancelled` emits `TEST_FAILURE`;
    on timeout emits `CONTEXT_GAP`
  - **promotion-agent** — promotes staging then production. **ADR-034
    is enforced here**: production refused unless a
    `promoted-staging` row exists for the same correlationId (emits
    `GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH`, deploy-orchestrator transitions to
    `escalated`). On success writes `promoted-staging` /
    `promoted-production` rows
  - Final transition: intent → `deployed` after production promote.
    All temp clones cleaned in `finally`
  - PipelineAdapter (ADR-033) abstraction: `createPullRequest`,
    `triggerPipeline`, `getPipelineStatus`, `promoteToEnvironment`.
    `GitHubActionsAdapter` (REST API + PAT from `project_git_credentials`)
    and `NoOpPipelineAdapter` (immediate plausible fakes with a 500ms
    pipeline-status delay so dashboards see the `running → passed`
    transition) included. Resolved per-task from `HARNESS.json`
    `pipeline.adapter`; absent or unrecognised → NoOp
  - First live cycle (`8f53b75d`, string-case utility module): 30s
    total — generate 17s → gate 2s → deploy 6s (PR open 2.5s,
    pipeline 1.9s, staging promote 1.0s, production promote 0.9s);
    intent → `deployed`. Branch `origin/gestalt/8f53b75d-add-a-string-case-utility-module`
    pushed to GitHub; deployment_events has all 5 expected rows
  - **First REAL GitHub Actions cycle (`67e5ee02`, kebab-case utility,
    2026-05-30 session).** Adapter switched from `noop` to
    `github-actions` via the new `gestalt projects set-adapter` CLI.
    49 s wall-clock total — generate 12 s → gate 1 s → deploy 30 s
    (pr-agent 4.6 s, pipeline-agent 21.0 s including the real GitHub
    Actions run, staging promote 1.8 s, production promote 1.8 s).
    PR #1 opened on `afarahat-lab/trackeros`, GitHub Actions run
    `26689527360` completed with `conclusion: success`,
    `event: workflow_dispatch`. All 5 `deployment_events` rows carry
    the real numeric `run_id` and a real `pr_url`; the dashboard /
    `gestalt status --id` are no longer faking. PAT-scope GP_BREACH
    path was NOT exercised (the PAT used had `workflow` scope);
    detection logic is unit-shaped and tested at the adapter level
    only. ADR-034 production-without-staging path also stays
    NoOp-validated since the cycle ran clean
- **Gate ↔ generate feedback loop wired.** A `fail` verdict (auto-resolvable
  signals, no GP_BREACH) dispatches a `generate:intent` task back to the
  generate queue with `retryCount + 1` and the signals routed to the
  responsible specialist agent (LINT_FAILURE / TEST_FAILURE / CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION
  → code-agent; CONTEXT_GAP → context-agent). The intent transitions
  `in-review → generating` for the retry. `code-prompt` includes a
  "Quality-gate feedback from the previous attempt" section listing every
  prior signal with file:line + rule. After `MAX_GATE_RETRIES = 3` cycles
  the gate gives up and marks the intent `failed`. The retry leg's commit
  uses `fix:` prefix and a `retry N/3` suffix so `git log` narrates the
  cycle history. Verified live (`2a57b087`): 4 cycles fired, all
  committed to Git, intent ended at `failed` after retry budget
  exhausted
- **Quality gate v1 wired end-to-end.** After the generate orchestrator
  pushes artifacts, the gate worker (registered as `startGateWorker(config.queue)`
  in `server.ts` step 7) clones the project repo fresh and runs:
  - `constraint-agent` — deterministic regex checks (no-any, no-console,
    no-direct-db-outside-shared-db, no-hardcoded-secret, no-direct-llm-sdk).
    Hardcoded-secret and direct-LLM-SDK emit GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH.
  - `llm-review-agent` — single LLM call summarising the artifact set;
    critical / golden-principle items become GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH
    signals, high/medium become CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION, low/info land in
    the prose review artifact only. Full review saved as
    `.gestalt/llm-review-<corr8>.md` in the `artifacts` table
  - `synthesiseGateResult` produces a verdict: any GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH
    → `escalate`; any CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION / TEST_FAILURE / LINT_FAILURE
    → `fail`; otherwise `pass`
  - Intent transitions: `in-review` → `approved` / `failed` / `escalated`
  - Gate emits `agent.started` / `agent.completed` / `signal.emitted`
    per agent + a top-level `gate.completed` event with verdict + summary
  - First live cycle (`b1f6eecd…`): constraint-agent caught a direct-DB
    import outside `shared/db/`; review-agent caught a missing GP-003
    input validation (escalating) + a potential data-exposure concern in
    the audit-log. Intent landed at `escalated` as designed
- **First full intent → code → push cycle verified end-to-end.** A real
  intent ("Add a hello world endpoint at GET /hello") ran six agents
  (intent / design completed, context + lint-config skipped, code +
  test completed) in ~11 seconds against `gpt-4o`, produced 7 artifacts,
  and the orchestrator committed + pushed `8938d51` to the project's
  GitHub repo (commit subject `feat: Add a hello world endpoint at GET
  /hello returning JSON {message:"hello" [gestalt 75000cb2]`). Files
  landed at the expected paths (`src/modules/hello/...`,
  `src/api/index.ts`, `src/shared/auth/rbac-middleware.ts`,
  `__tests__/hello-routes.test.ts`, `.gestalt/{intent,design}-spec.json`).
  `git pull` on the developer's local clone yields them
- Generate-layer cycles are fully observable and write to Git:
  - one `agent_executions` row per step (`running` → `completed` /
    `failed` / `skipped`) with `tokensUsed` + `durationMs`
  - every `result.signals` saved to `signals`; every `result.artifacts`
    saved to `artifacts`
  - SSE events emitted on the in-process bus at every transition —
    `intent.status-changed`, `agent.started`, `agent.completed`,
    `signal.emitted` — verified by tapping `GET /events?token=…` during a
    real submission
  - on a successful cycle the orchestrator writes artifacts into the
    cloned tree, commits `feat: <intent> [gestalt <corr8>]`, and pushes
    to `defaultBranch`; developers `git pull` to receive
  - the event bus lives in `@gestalt/core/events` so both the server SSE
    route and the orchestrator publish on the same singleton without an
    agents → server dep cycle
- `gestalt init local-admin` (old broken syntax) now fails fast with a
  clear error (`allowExcessArguments(false)` on init command)
- `GET /status`, `GET /status/agents`, `GET /intents`, `GET /intents/:id`
  all return 200

**Implemented with caveats (worth knowing):**
- `@gestalt/agents-quality-gate` — constraint-agent + llm-review-agent +
  gate orchestrator implemented and exercised live. lint-agent /
  security-agent / test-runner-agent remain stubs (need a
  pnpm-install-in-clone pipeline to run real tooling); the package
  works end-to-end without them via the two implemented agents
- `@gestalt/agents-deploy` — pr-agent + pipeline-agent + promotion-agent
  + deploy orchestrator implemented. Two `PipelineAdapter` impls live
  (`GitHubActions`, `NoOp`); Azure DevOps / GitLab CI / Jenkins
  adapters intentionally not implemented (one concrete adapter was the
  ADR-033 scope)
- `@gestalt/agents-maintenance` — all four agents (drift, alignment,
  gc, evaluation) + node-cron scheduler + three `MonitoringAdapter`
  impls (`Prometheus`, `Datadog`, `NoOp`) implemented and exercised
  live via `POST /maintenance/trigger`. Prometheus / Datadog
  implementations not yet verified against a real monitoring instance

**What is not yet built:**
- `@gestalt/adapter-oracle` — stub (every repository method throws;
  exists only to surface interface drift at build time)
- `@gestalt/adapter-mssql` — same shape as oracle
- `@gestalt/registry` — types and client only (no server, no UI)

**Postgres adapter repository coverage (all real, no remaining stubs):**
- `intents`     — full CRUD + list with paging + `saveClarification`
  (writes operator clarification text to the nullable column added
  in migration 006; orchestrator reads it on every dispatch so it
  survives gate-retry legs)
- `executions`  — create, updateStatus, findByCorrelationId, findActive
- `artifacts`   — save, findByCorrelationId (typed filter), findById
- `signals`     — save, findByCorrelationId, findUnresolved, markResolved
  (with GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH human-only guard)
- `audit`       — append-only, query with filters
- `users`       — upsert, findById, findByIdpSubject, list, count
- `localAuth`   — create, findByEmail
- `projects`    — create, findById, findByName, list, saveCredential,
  getCredential (token stored plain — TODO: encrypt at rest)
- `deploymentEvents` — append, findByCorrelationId, findStagingPromotion,
  gcOlderThan. UPDATE is still revoked; DELETE was REVOKED in migration
  004 then GRANTed back in migration 005 once it was clarified that
  deployment_events are operational logs (not audit records) and
  gc-agent needs to prune them. ADR-034 enforcement runs through
  `findStagingPromotion`
- `maintenanceRuns` — create (status=running), complete (final counts +
  findings JSONB + duration), list (filter by projectId / agentRole).
  Findings are JSONB-array-typed; the PG impl uses an explicit
  `::jsonb` cast on insert/update (without it postgres' implicit
  text→jsonb cast wraps the whole array as a JSON string scalar) and
  `parseFindings` normalises the read path against postgres.js
  returning either a parsed array or a raw JSON string
- `alerts` — create, findById, findUnacknowledged, findByCorrelationId,
  acknowledge. `intent_id` lives in `context` JSONB (schema 001
  predates the FK); `parseContext` normalises postgres.js's
  parsed-object vs raw-JSON-string return shapes the same way
  `parseFindings` does for maintenanceRuns. `intentId` lifted out of
  context into the read-side record for ergonomics

**CLI install:**
- `@gestalt/cli` is private — not on npm
- Install: `pnpm --filter @gestalt/cli build && cd packages/cli && npm link`

**First-boot sequence:**
1. `docker-compose up -d` — start platform
2. `gestalt init-admin` — create admin user (TTY only, once per server)
3. `gestalt login` — authenticate CLI
4. `mkdir my-project && cd my-project`
5. `git init && git remote add origin <url>`
6. `gestalt init` — register project + server pushes harness to Git
7. `git pull` — receive harness files locally
8. `gestalt run "<intent>"` — submit work to agents

**Pending enhancements (design in chat first):**
- **`GET /alerts` has no `projectId` filter.** The dashboard's
  Alerts view filters client-side by joining each alert's
  `context.intentId` against the current project's intent list,
  which costs an extra `/intents?projectId=…` call per refresh.
  A server-side query parameter that joins the alerts table to
  intents (or to a `project_id` column added directly on
  `alerts`) would let the API return the filtered set in one
  call and let the Layout's badge count match the visible list
  without extra plumbing
- **POST /interventions still a 501 stub.** The clarification flow
  bypasses it (uses `POST /intents/:id/clarify` directly because
  that endpoint owns the resume side effect). When breach
  acknowledgement / promotion approval get UIs they'll need a
  real implementation here
- **Return-URL preservation across login.** Pasting `/app/intents/<id>`
  in a fresh tab today bounces to `/app/login` and after sign-in
  lands on `/app/` (the intent ID is dropped). Small SPA-only change —
  `useLocation()` + `?from=` query param in the `RequireAuth` Navigate
  and the Login view's post-success `navigate(...)`. ~10 minutes
- **Vite dev-server proxy `/api` entry is dead.** The proxy in
  `packages/dashboard/vite.config.ts` forwards `/api → localhost:3000`
  but the server has no routes under `/api`. Pre-existing dead
  config; remove on the next dashboard-config touch
- **Encrypt Git PATs at rest.** `project_git_credentials.token` is plain
  text. Documented TODO in `repositories/projects.ts`. Pick a key-management
  approach before any shared/production use
- **LLM model name validation.** `loadConfig` accepts any non-empty string
  for `LLM_MODEL`. Worth adding a startup-time ping or clear error path
- Non-interactive mode for `gestalt init-admin` (--email/--password flags)
  for scripted use — current implementation is TTY-only
- **Retry cycle full re-runs all generate agents** even though only the
  routed agents need fresh work (code-agent typically). Cheaper retries
  would skip intent/design/context when their prior artifacts are
  present in the Git tip. For now: ~50-60s per retry cycle. Tracked as
  an optimisation, not a correctness gap
- **Read `qualityGate.maxRetries` from the project's HARNESS.json** —
  currently hardcoded to 3 in both the gate and generate orchestrators
- **Other PipelineAdapter implementations** (Azure DevOps, GitLab CI,
  Jenkins). The interface is in place; only `GitHubActions` + `NoOp`
  are implemented today. `GitHubActions` is verified end-to-end (see
  `67e5ee02` cycle in the session log); the others are typed stubs in
  the `PipelineAdapterType` union but have no implementation
- **`set-adapter` only switches `pipeline.adapter` today.** The
  `POST /projects/:id/config` body shape is generic
  (`{ pipeline?: ... }`) — adding monitoring (`maintenance.monitoring.adapter`)
  and `qualityGate.maxRetries` follows the same whitelist + clone-edit-
  commit pattern but is not implemented yet
- **Promotion workflow dispatches against a hardcoded `'main'` ref.**
  `GitHubActionsAdapter.promoteToEnvironment` always sends
  `{"ref":"main",...}` instead of the project's `defaultBranch`.
  Projects on `master`/`trunk`/etc. will see the promotion workflow
  fail to dispatch. Thread `project.defaultBranch` through the
  promotion-agent → adapter call to fix
- **No proactive PAT-scope validation at registration / set-adapter
  time.** A PAT missing `workflow` scope only surfaces on the first
  pipeline dispatch (`GOLDEN_PRINCIPLE_BREACH` signal + intent
  `escalated`). A startup-time `GET /user` + `GET /repos/:o/:r` ping
  in `init-harness` / `set-adapter` would catch the misconfiguration
  before any intent cycle
- **Promotion strategy beyond auto.** Today both staging → production
  fires unconditionally on a passed pipeline. The `EnvironmentStrategy`
  type already supports `trigger: 'manual'` + `approvals: N`; wire that
  through promotion-agent once a human-approval UI exists
- **Real-tooling gate agents** (typecheck via `tsc`, lint via ESLint,
  tests via `vitest`). Each needs the project's deps installed in the
  cloned tree — likely a `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` step before
  the agents run, with the install output cached
- **alignment-agent entity extractor is too loose.** Matches every
  `## Word` and `- **Word**` line in DOMAIN.md as an entity, including
  template headings like "Description" / "Status" — produces false
  positives like "entity 'description' has no module" intents. Tighten
  the regex to require capitalised-PascalCase + skip a known stop list
  (Description, Status, Notes, etc.)
- **Live Prometheus / Datadog adapters not yet exercised.** Built
  against the published REST API shapes; unit-tested smoke would
  require a monitoring system. NoOp adapter is the verified path
- **drift-agent additive note can churn DOMAIN.md** if the agent runs
  daily and the module keeps changing. Should de-dupe against existing
  notes (the current `includes(note)` check uses the exact day, so the
  next day's note appears as a new line — fine for low-volume
  projects, may need rolling-window dedupe for active ones)
